Our project uses NLP and machine learning to determine the statistical similarity between three subreddits. We examine the overlap between r/Anxiety, r/Depression, and r/COVID19_support over the period March 2020. Our github contains 3 topic modeling notebooks that use Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Total Correlation Explanation to determine the topical nodes of the subreddits. One can compare the subreddits by putting the visualizations in these notebooks side by side. The subreddit comparison notebook utilizes t-SNE and UMAP to compare all three subreddits, corroborating what is indicated in the topic modeling analysis. 

The results of our data analysis indicate that in March of 2020 subredditers in the Anxiety subreddit were much more concerned about the coronavirus pandemic than Depression subredditers. Participants in the COVID19_support subreddit were also using rhetoric much closer to the Anxiety subredditers.
