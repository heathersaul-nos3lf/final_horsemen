Our project aims to visualize the statistical similarities between two subreddits. We propose to examine the overlap between r/agoraphobia and r/COVID19_support subreddits, both places full of people fearful to venture outside, one chronic and one situational. We aim to pull posts from both subreddits and analyze the language used with machine learning. We believe it will be interesting to compare the two as some people in r/COVID19_support appear to be developing agoraphobia, and coronavirus is mentioned in r/agoraphobia as well, and we could clearly show this relationship between them. We will create visualizations such as a swarm pie plot (word bubbles) showing each of the notable words used in each and the percentage belonging to each subreddit.
