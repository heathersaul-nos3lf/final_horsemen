9,1583145120,Throwawayyyyyyy71171,After two years it‚Äôs finally over,"All my life I‚Äôve struggled with social anxiety. Two years ago I began developing agoraphobia which was accompanied by severe stress and many sleepless nights. 

My muscles would stiffen and hurt incredibly to the point it was difficult to move. I even developed a stomach ulcer due to the overwhelming anxiety I experienced. 

But now I can say it‚Äôs finally over. Something spontaneous happened. I no longer felt anxiety or stress. I could finally sleep at night. I dropped taking anti-medications such as Xanax and Ativan long ago. 

Now things are looking up for me. Tomorrow I‚Äôll be taking my driving test which I have no anxiety about. As before I would‚Äôve been stressing about it for weeks prior to the test. 

In the following months I‚Äôll be moving to NYC where I got accepted and got a scholarship at a university where I‚Äôll be attending medical school. 

**TDLR:** There is a cure for agoraphobia. Set long term goals and use temporary meds such as benzodiazepines as a tool to deal with foreign situations to learn and grow from them so the next time you go through it, you‚Äôll know what to expect without needing them.",/r/Agoraphobia/comments/fca77a/after_two_years_its_finally_over/

I need your help. I've reached out to my therapist but he hasn't called back yet. I started a new job and I'm freaking out. Terribly. I work 8 hours a day in a hospital and yesterday was my first day. It was okay, I don't particularly enjoy the work but it's honestly okay I'm okay with it. Yet, on my way home I was experiencing this angst that let me quit my last occupation. I don't want to feel this dread and feelings of wanting to quit on the spot. I don't want to quit but the agoraphobia is telling me to. It's screaming in my face that I need to quit but I'm refusing. I need to take this chance or I won't get another one. This is ridiculous. Why do I feel this way even though I don't hate my job? After all it was just the first day and yes I was really really exhausted after walking all day (hospital job) but that's not at all any cause to quit?

Please help me deal with this angst. How do I keep it at bay?

16,1583293827,xWiccan,Advice,"Hello, I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice.. I struggle with extreme social anxiety, GAD, ptsd, and agoraphobia to name a few. Every day I have been pushing myself to go out in public (granted I always have to have someone with me) and I‚Äôve been feeling really overwhelmed. I am 22 and I haven‚Äôt ever been able to hold a job. The longest job I had was part time for 4 months and I‚Äôm surprised I didn‚Äôt get fired (I called out constantly because of my panic attacks and anxiety). That was 3 years ago almost. 

Anyway, today was supposed to be my first day at a new job... Last week I managed to get through the interview, accept the position, even called on the phone (which is something I haven‚Äôt been able to do for 2 years), and got through walking in to do the basic hiring info. Ever since I‚Äôve been extremely stressed and anxious. I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all last night and watched each minute pass on the clock the entire time, trying to ground myself, soothe myself, remind myself it was okay, etc. I cried, had anxiety attacks, got dressed, and got to the front of the building. I couldn‚Äôt walk in, even with my wife right there. I started to freak out and she supported me through the entire thing, but I feel miserable and I feel like a failure. I told myself I was proud that I even made it as far as I had, but I can‚Äôt help feeling overwhelming disappointment. I didn‚Äôt call in. I‚Äôm supposed to go in tomorrow, too. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to work, I want to be a normal functioning human, I want to help my family out and do something with myself. Should I try talking to the manager about it? I mean I haven‚Äôt even started there yet and missed my first day (which was only computer training as far as I know). I‚Äôve been depressed about it and I want to not screw up another opportunity. I‚Äôm so thankful I even got a job, but every time I screw it up... Any advice? Should I just.. try to work in being kinder to myself and keep taking those baby steps? I‚Äôve tried to get disability, but I‚Äôve gotten denied twice because I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have enough work history‚Äù and I can barely leave the house as it is to do anything..

20,1583302720,anon1232213,"My trip down the agoraphobia hole, and how Ive been making progress to get out of it.","I left home at 13. 

I moved into a derelict household that was home to 15+ delinquent teens and drug-addicted 20 year olds, and quickly picked up a dependence on weed and alcohol. 

Naturally I found myself in many situations a 13 year old should never be in. Violence, drug-abuse, and sexual promiscuity/misconduct were every day occurrences. There was never any food, and the power and water would be shut off for weeks on end. It was a horrible environment. I learned how to survive off one meal a day if I was lucky, and washing clothes became a long lost luxury. I had to fight to eat, fight to sleep on the couch, I‚Äôd have to fight just to survive. 13 through 14 was just learning how to survive. 

I‚Äôd have to write a book if I wanted to get into every little situation that occurred in that house so we‚Äôll just leave that at that. 

By the time I was 15 I was dabbling i‚Äôm harder drugs and many of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù had began getting into guns. I figured if they had them I should too. Once I got my first pistol I decided that robbing drug dealers would make better money than selling dime bags to other 15 year olds. So I did. It was a very dark time, and this was around the time I first started feeling real anxiety. To this day I still need to sleep on my left side so my ‚Äúshooter hip‚Äù would still be accessible if anyone came in at night looking for trouble. I thank god that I never had to use my gun because I would have easily ruined my life, and condemned myself to decades in prison. 

I think it goes without saying that I wasn‚Äôt going to school this entire time, and once the principal had enough of me causing issues on campus he sent me to an alternative school. Even the teachers at the school said it was ‚ÄúPrison-prep‚Äù. Concrete walls, tall metal fences, and police at every corner at all hours of the day. Once a week they would do drug sweeps and pick up 10-15 kids to take em to jail. They brought 2 paddy-wagons everytime because they knew that they wouldn‚Äôt have enough space in their squad cars. 

I met a lot of seedy characters, and eventually me and some of the top dogs from the house began commanding our own little crew of teenage robbers. Most of them ended up in jail or getting hurt and staying away from us. At the time it felt like I was on top of the world, but looking back it was my rock bottom. I was doing drugs as fast as I could get them, and spending money as fast as I made it. It was the most disheartening feeling to make a few hundred dollars in a day but still go to bed hungry. 

Once I turned 16 a close friend of mine was murdered a few blocks from our house. The blood trail showed that he tried dragging himself towards our house, his hands were still curled from gripping the pavement. That really broke me, I was in a constant state of panic that whole summer. From the minute I woke up to the second I went to bed I was curled up on the floor next to a trash can. I realized that if I kept up the lifestyle I was living that I wouldn‚Äôt make it to 20. So I reconnected with an old friend who had left the house about a year prior. His family took me in, treated me as one of their own. It was the first time I had ever felt like anyone really cared about me. 

My friend took me to the river and we threw my guns in and watched them sink. Shared a doobie and swapped stories about what had happened in that house. This was when my agoraphobia really started setting in. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the house, I was scared that I‚Äôd have to face the people I wronged, or that people would still think of me as ‚Äúthe old me‚Äù. 

I started up at a new school, it was a tiny building with 4 classrooms and no more than 50 students (most of which didn‚Äôt show up). The teachers really cared about me and wanted me to have some form of education, they helped me get my GED and got me started on college classes. 

But even though everything was said and done I was still the same person, I had never had the chance to really process everything. Anxiety attacks became a daily issue. I didn‚Äôt know how to be a functioning member of society. Hell I barely even knew how to work a washing machine. 

I became a major recluse, never left the house. Eventually dropped out of college. I was completely lost. At 16 I thought I had used up any and all karma the universe had in store for me. I thought I‚Äôd die any day. Not only that but I thought I deserved it. 

I was able to kick my hard drug habit because I was too afraid to seek out any dealers. I didn‚Äôt know who might have it out for me. 

Once I was off drugs it became clear that I needed to rekindle my relationship with my family. By the time I had actually gotten around to it I was 17. 

Funnily enough I met my girlfriend at this time, we are still together to this day. She really helped me get out of the survival mindset, but all the little quirks and habits remained. I‚Äôd snap at her if she talked to me while I was eating, she‚Äôd have to sleep on the left side of the bed so I could sleep on my left side, and I praise her endlessly for putting up with me during this time. 

I still wasn‚Äôt leaving the house, I refused to do minimal things like going to the store, and if she asked me to come with her to a social get togethers I would have full on mental breakdowns. 

It took me some serious time to realize I needed help. 

Eventually after getting tired of having panic attacks everyday I figured talking to a psychiatrist couldn‚Äôt hurt. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Panic Disorder, and Agoraphobia. 

After talking with a case manager and therapist for about a year I realized that I was stuck in survival mode. The only skills I had were the ones necessary to survive on the streets. I had to build real-world skills, and to this day I don‚Äôt have them all down. I recently had a bad episode where I went back to being housebound from July of last year to about a month ago. 

I would cry and pray every day ‚ÄúWill I be normal again?‚Äù 

But over time, by quitting alcohol and weed, and restarting exposure therapy, I‚Äôve finally found some peace of mind again. I still have bad days, but they aren‚Äôt as bad as they used to be, and I‚Äôve accepted that having a bad day or episode doesn‚Äôt remove any of the progress I have made. I am my own man now. I‚Äôm 10 years removed from all the bullshit that troubled me in the past, and I‚Äôm making steps every single day to get better. 

The path to getting better may not be linear, but I will get better. Nothing can stop my progress.

Will this ever end? Can i live my life again?

2 years ago i had a ptsd incident where a client died suddenly in my arms. I didnt cope well and got extreme hypochondriaca. I had panic attacks i couldnt connect to the incident and 4 months into the panic attempts i was unable to go to stores or be in the car longer than 15min. The panic attacks started happening every 3 days. So i moved from idaho to new york city for care. 

Since the panic ive had 6 ekgs, 38 doctors visits, cardiologist, obgyn, 72 hour Holter monitor, 18 blood tests for EVERYTHING, thyroid sonograms, stress test, echocardiogram, endocrinologist, mri of my brain, 4 chest x rays, 3 breathing tests, and the list goes on.

I became completely housebound November through may of 2018. The most i did in a day was drive to the store 6 minutes away and get 2 items. Most days i panicked ane cried trying to drive around the block for exposure therapy.

June 20th i moved to texas to live with my family and seek more care. I couldnt work or take care of myself. The lovely relationship i had with my boyfriend of almost 4 years had turned into an abusive toxic relationship. He would scream and leave and threaten to not get me food anymore or help. Broke things daily and told me to kill myself. Our relationship was never like this before.

When i moved to texas i panicked. Things were hard. Me and my boyfriend broke up. I lost my freedom, money, travel, my beloved dog, boyfriend stole 1k from my savings, and at 23 i felt my life was ending to go home and live with my parents again.

My parents refused to enable me. They made me shop for my own food and held me accountable for my therapy and psychiatrist. Here i am 7 months later and i have a job at a home owned pie shop as a baker while i work on my masters degree.

I got a horrible burn that kept me inside for 8 days unable to move. And when i finally got out i PANICKED! I thought, this is it. I couldn't go out for exposure therapy for so long idk what i am going to do. I had a panic attack. I still have them. But i sit through and calm myself down within minutes.

I finally realized the progress ive made today as i drove 3 hours with no sleep and crying in pain and in the rain. Cooked dinner, saw my doctor, and went out to a nice dinner and walked around downtown dallas with my best friend getting bakery goods.

For a whole year i couldn't leave my house. I spent my birthday alone, chirstmas alone, thanskgiving, ect.

In the last 3 months ive been to paris, london, chicago, nyc, LA. I have gotten a job and started school.

So many times ive almost given up on life... So many times ivr almost given up on the process and on myself. But today i am a 23 year old girl. I have panic attacks and anxiety. But i am living my life. I finally feel whole again. I wanted to thank this group, as i have made many life long friends and talked to so many support systems throughout my journey.

Today was an ugly reminder that this thing still lurks around waiting to pounce. I am moving to a new house and needed to meet the furniture drop off guy so he could set the furniture up. 

Well I had gotten sick last night with fever and hardly slept, but still needed to be at the house for this furniture drop off. Turns out it takes a lot longer than I expected and also turns out anxiety doesn‚Äôt like lack of sleep, or fevers. 

So I panicked off and on for a few hours and was miserable, but I made it through it and didn‚Äôt die. The drive home was even worse because I thought my fever was so high I would black out or something. Made it through that as well. 

Even though that experience was horrible and wouldn‚Äôt wish it on my worst enemy, I made it. You all can too. Take it from a guy that didn‚Äôt leave his rooms for months. 

Tldr: made it through a tough time even though it sucked. Sometimes we need to find the silver linings.",/r/Agoraphobia/comments/fdln4t/today_was_a_tough_one/

I don't know why I am sharing all of this... maybe because some people might relate and take comfort in know they are not alone in the struggle. Here are some highs and lows of my recovery. I am at the very beginning stages.

High highs:

\-Ventured out of the house at dusk with my partner and walked to the ocean. We saw some insects and the birds along the way, which I love to watch, and that brought me joy and helped me focus on something positive.

\-Ventured out to a D&amp;D game. It was a small group and I had my partner go first to make sure everything was safe. I had a lot of fun and it was my first positive interaction with ""real people"" who are not my husband/therapist/doctor/psychiatrist in a super long time.

\-I have been trying to go out into the backyard at least daily to do small tasks... tend the garden for a short time, hang up laundry, take out the trash, etc. Something just to get me outside.

Low low lows:

\- People from a community mental health wrap around service group (mouthful) of some kind came to my house to 'interview' me. They asked a lot of questions about my past, my present struggles, etc. It was triggering. I cried a couple times. I cry everyday so the first time it was my normal weepy self. But near the end I had a breakdown/panic attack. I have one of those almost daily too but it was hard to do it in front of these strangers. I know they are professionals and see this everyday but still.

\-Had to venture out of the house into the city for another therapy appointment. I hate going to the city. What makes it worse is I walk by two specific buildings I want to jump off of. They always trigger my suicidal thoughts.

\-I have been tailoring off my current medications to start new ones. Withdrawal.

\-We are moving to a new house this weekend. I have moved every year for the past 10 years. I am so tired of moving and just wish I could stay in one place longer than a year.

\-My moods overall have been extreme lately. I cycle up, down, and all around all throughout the day. At the end of the day, I am exhausted. I am just feeling so much stress from all of this it has been so difficult!",/r/Agoraphobia/comments/fer2tu/week_of_high_highs_and_low_low_lows/

10,1583588371,mooncussser,Realizing I might have Agoraphobia,"I‚Äôve always considered them to be crashes, because that is how they would make me feel. It was always in situations I felt like I couldn‚Äôt escape, like an important meeting at work, riding in the car with someone, or dinner with my boyfriend‚Äôs family. I get panicky. I have difficulty breathing normally. Shaky, light headed. I lose sense of everything and have. A hard time focusing on anything except my racing thoughts that I‚Äôm going to freak out and make a scene. I feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of tweaking out. My limbs will feel heavy like they don‚Äôt work anymore so I start doing weird movement and twitching just make sure I still have control. Writing becomes extremely difficult (so awful during meetings when I am trying to appear ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù) I have such a fear that someone is going to ask me to do something that requires fine motor skills when I have no control over my hands. I had a one on one coffee meeting with my boss the other day and I couldn‚Äôt even take a sip of my drink in front her because I was afraid that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to hold my glass. For a long time I thought the ‚Äúcrash‚Äù was food related. But then I realized it‚Äôs because social situations like going out to lunch with someone make me feel trapped. Having to talk, wait for the waitress/food to be ready, waiting, waiting, waiting while just wanting to run from the table. Having to keep up conversations, whether professional during a meeting or simple like joking around my boyfriend in the car feels impossible when it feels like my insides are imploding and I feel like I‚Äôm about to pass out and die. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to form words. They come out jarbled and weird. But I keep doing it. Say anything. Smile and nod. Excuse myself to the bathroom to try to breathe and calm down. Sometimes this helps. Other times, especially if the bathroom is busy, it‚Äôs awful. I fear having no place to go to be alone. I panic thinking about how I can lie to get out the situation and get home as fast as possible. But then I remember I have to walk to the subway. Take the subway, get off. Walk to my home. It‚Äôs the process that scares me. So many steps I have to take just so I can feel safe at home. When I just want out NOW. 
For a long time I thought it was something like blood sugar or pressure related (too scared to see a doctor to find out, lol, of course) so I just dealt with it. But then I quit my job and had a few months of peace and quiet. The attacks didn‚Äôt come when I wasn‚Äôt trapped in an office space with no privacy surrounded by people who scared me. It was like a breath of fresh air. I have always struggled with general anxiety and depression (although not diagnosed.) But then I recently started a new job. It‚Äôs gotten so bad because I am scared of my boss (she is very mean and cold) and it is a very meeting-oriented work culture. I‚Äôm constantly trapped and watched. At least at my old job there was a bathroom in the basement where I could be alone. I would hide there, sit on the ground (gross I know, but it helped!) and breathe. There is no privacy here. There are over 700 employees. Someone is always in the bathroom with me. 
I feel crazy that I didn‚Äôt realize even the possibility of agoraphobia before. I just thought it was the fear of crowds (which I don‚Äôt experience), or something more like claustrophobia. I feel like a switch has been flipped. I feel less alone. I feel hopeful that I can someday get help. 
Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. It feels amazing to know I‚Äôm not alone.

26,1583780704,carcrashtrash,Does this sound like agoraphobia?,"TW for harassment

I've lived in Paris for 6 months now, and due to experiences of living there have become fearful of leaving the house.

Paris has a major problem with men; harassment on the street is common, including catcalling, stalking and not letting you leave until they get a phone number. As a young woman, I have been followed many times. 

Over the past few weeks it seems to be getting worse. Every time I leave the house it is GUARANTEED that at least two or three men will come up and pester me. (no, I don't wear makeup and try to look my worst when out in public). In the supermarket, walking down the street, even people in positions of trust like waiters (one recently got my number and proceeded to call me 11 times in an hour before I blocked him).

Anyway, its making me feel both disgusted and terrified. I'm not a sex object, I want to be able to go about my life normally without constantly being harassed, but now it's hard for me to go out because I don't feel safe in public. Nothing bad will happen and I carry an alarm, but it's them coming up to me, a socially awkward person, in the first place which triggers panic.

I don't go to my lessons anymore, and before this afternoon hadn't left the house for a week and a half. I had a panic attack when leaving before. Is this the start of agoraphobia?

0,1583890386,marsupial65,Things are looking up,"These past 24 hours have been promising. 

I recently moved to a new house and the first 24 hours were really hard. I had some low lows and panic attacks, and I spent a lot of time laying on the couch and peeking out the window. 

However, these past 24 hours have been promising. Yesterday in the later afternoon I pushed myself to meet my daily goal of going on a walk once a day. I have been gaining a lot of weight in the past 6 months, so I am hoping this will help. Anyway, I went on a 5 minute walk w/ my husband and then rushed back to my house. Then, about an hour later, I decided to try again and went on a 10 minute walk. This morning, we walked all the way to the 2nd further bus stop to get to my therapy appointment! I felt really proud and accomplished to get some exercise out in the sunshine. And the neighborhood, from what I saw during those few minutes, is actually quite nice.

My second celebration in these past 24 hours was that I had a promising therapy appt. This therapist is new and I am only on session 3, but I think it might actually help me. After leaving, I felt really positive, which is something I often don't feel after therapy. She gave me homework for the week and I am excited to meet some of my mini goals. Is recovery possible? I feel that it may be... but maybe that is because I have had a good past 24 hours?!",/r/Agoraphobia/comments/fgp5wt/things_are_looking_up/

I know logically I'm not in danger,  but my mind becomes flooded with anxiety and I start to panic. I become very nauseous and dizzy. I cant breathe,my heart beats out of my chest, my lungs burn and I start shaking violently. I cant concentrate and my thoughts start spinning. The only thing that helps is wrapping myself in a weighted blanket.This works well at home, but obviously, I cant carry one around everywhere so I dont know how to cope.

All the while I just thought what I have is social anxiety, but after further digging, research and insightful psychotherapy sessions, I realized that I had hidden multiple disorders in which the effects snowballed from childhood. They were only triggered after an especially traunatic event.

So far, I've learnt that there is a high chance that I might have PTSD, AvPD, GAD, Social Anxiety and bordering on being agoraphobic (although the need for social interaction doesnt affect me much, i pretty much crave the opposite).

It took a long time for me to recover and I never really told anyone about it but then something worse happened. Now I wanted to be alone but I just couldn‚Äôt step outside my home except for school. Every time I was at a public place or simply anywhere that wasn‚Äôt my room, I would sense fear. I did have a lot of panic attacks and fainted several times. Every time I saw people outside I felt like I wanted to cover my face and hide. It felt like I‚Äôm about get attacked or something. I shivered. I didn‚Äôt know what agoraphobia was back then. My parents noticed and pressured me to go outside more but stopped as soon as I fainted for the first time. It was horrible I couldn‚Äôt do anything. I couldn‚Äôt even walk down the streets beside my house. It just felt very uncomfortable and unsafe. This lasted for almost 3 years and then after a long time I decided to step outside again and everything was fine. I no longer panicked and could easily go anywhere I wanted to.

However, slowly I felt like my sense of fear is coming back. Now, I‚Äôm trapped inside my house again. I can‚Äôt go outside anymore. Even when I do, I end up covering and face with a hoodie and try to hide and go home as soon as possible. Seeing people outside just scares me. I‚Äôm scared, of everything.

I always struggled with these kinds of basic interactions and to ease the tension I felt, I told the clerk that my gf just had an operation. The guy behind me sneered and said something like ‚Äúyeah right, what did she get, a bong hit transplant?‚Äù. I was already so fragile at that point I couldn‚Äôt take it.

6,1583952456,SuperSecretSpare,A simple guide to begin working from home,"Hello everyone. I am not agoraphobic, but was recommended here by a member that is. They believed that my work online guide could be beneficial for some of you, so I wanted to reach out and post it. I apologize in advance for any methods that include in person testing as this is mainly a copy paste from the other post. I am happy to answer any questions or give a hand where needed. Hope you all enjoy.

Before the main post, I am including the best deals or opportunities that I have found online recently. This will be updated as often as old deals die or I find something newer and better.

Top deals for March 2020
----

----
 
[Swagbucks $15-$35 Hulu deal](https://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=50837036)

Right now SB has another deal where you get credits to sign up to Hulu with the $5.99 plan. It may only be $20 or it may be $35 when you check as they seem to change it day to day. Since this deal has new terms, the credits might be paid out immediately or after 32 days. The credits can be used for Amazon GC or PayPal credit (both take a few days to get processed). Not only that, but you can get a $25 Amazon GC for $22 worth of points, so you can make even more. You can cancel the subscription after 8 days, but no sooner so you don't lose the points. So, five minutes of work for the equivalent of $16-$29 and a free month of Hulu.

[$25-$50 from SoFi for opening an account and depositing $100](https://www.sofi.com/share/money/2641744/)

This one will require you to have $100 that you can do without for a few days. SoFi Money is a savings account, fee-free, 2% APY annual; so typical bank account. This deal will require you to use your SSN, link a bank account, and do a soft pull with Experian to complete. You just need to create a SoFi Money account through the link, deposit $100 to the account, and wait for a few days. This is different than most bank account bonuses because it doesn't need direct deposit, just a regular $100 deposit. After the deposit clears (1-2 business days), SoFi will instantly give you $50 bonus. After you get the $50 bonus you can pull out all $150 and close the account or keep using it.

[Another $100 from SoFi but for stocks](https://www.sofi.com/share/invest/2641744/)

After you get the $25 sign up bonus from SoFi Money, flip it through this link and fund the invest account with $1,000. Since I (and you now) already had an account, it literally took under 5 minutes to set up and fund the account. Either way you do it, SoFi will give you an additional $50 in free stock of your choice. Keep it and hope it grows, or sell it for the quick $50 profit. 

[$50 from Chime for opening an account and depositing $200](https://chime.com/r/roberthurst8)

Pretty much the same exact set up as SoFi. This one will require you to have $200 that you can do without for a few days. You just need to create the Chime account through the link, deposit $200 to the account, and wait for a few days. It says direct deposit only, but this tested and worded with just connecting a bank account and doing the deposit. After the deposit clears (1-2 business days), Chime will instantly give you $50 bonus. After you get the $50 bonus you have to wait until your new debit card arrives and is activated before you can move the money out.

[$50 from eToro](https://etoro.tw/31a5o9b)

This is a crypto trading account. The same deal as the other ones. Fund the account using the ref link and get $50. The wait time on this one is usually around 7 business days.

[$10-$120 in crypto for watching videos and answering quiz questions](https://coinbase.com/earn/oxt/invite/cfspw3b9)

Pretty much just watch and answer videos for varying types of crypto. The crypto you earn will get deposited into the wallet you create, which can then be cashed out into USD. Depending on the day, you can earn up to $120 if all free tokens are available.

[$10-$40 for signing up with OhmConnect](https://ohm.co/7secondman)

A great website if you have one of a few utility companies in California, Texas, or Toronto. OhmConnect supports PGE, SCE, SDGE, Smart Meter Texas, and Toronto Hydro. You essentially just connect your utility account, and earn points. You earn $10 after signing up and getting to a status level of Silver (took me like 10 minutes). $10 more if you connect a smart device like NEST.

*The following are ref links that I am putting in for a random Redditor or two, just to spread goodwill and try to give back to all of you. I get nothing from these and will be doing this for one or two random people every month. PM me if you want your ref link featured here. The Redditor for February is u/SirRaygun* 

[Sign up with Qapital and deposit $1 to earn $20](https://get.qapital.com/y2bsNIAXH0) 

Qapital is an app that wants its users to save money to prevent themselves from getting in bad financial troubles. There is a subscription cost, like 3 or 5 bucks, but if you do it quick enough, they won't bill you if you cancel the account.

All you have to do is link your checking account, and deposit a dollar into a goal to save for something. After a few business days, the $20 will be given to you which can be withdrawn to your bank account with that initial dollar. Close the account immediately after the withdraw.

Ok. Back to the main post content.

Hey everyone. This is an all-inclusive write-up compiling all of my past posts on how I am making upwards of $1,000 a month through the use of beermoney sites. Beermoney is, according to Urban Dictionary, ""Extra money for non-essential payments, available for spending on luxuries, hobbies, or a fresh pint of your favorite draft."" I use this definition, because this is (in most cases) not intended to be a primary source of income. This is a way to supplement what you already have. There is no way to know what you will make any given month, so do not count on it. My worst month I only made around $500 and my best I made over $2,000. You can also check out my post on [using apps to save money and earn cash back](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuperSecretSpare/comments/au5am7/saving_money_online_in_2019/).

As I have stated in my other posts, this is not a definitive list of everything a person can do online by any means and refs are included. Do your own research on the subs I list, use Google, ask other people, and find what works for you. What I talk about works well for me, my family, and my schedule. Below I will include time requirements to make this money, provide a quick recap of the revenue streams that I have found to work, and provide payment proof for what I can. 

I personally invest anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week doing these sites, on top of my day job. Some days I will make $20 all day, and others I will make over $200. I prefer this, as opposed to a second job, because I can pay partial attention to a laptop and 'clock-out' when I want to focus on family or Netflix. This works better for my temperament and preferences. 

----

Tech required: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), an internet connection, and a fairly good amount of patience to learn. If you are in a position where these tools are not available, you can also do many of these from a library. 

----

I put all of this info into an e-book, plus a TON of other stuff that was either written by me, or compiled from others (with their permission). [Here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W795PBP) is a link to it. If you tried even half of the stuff in the book, you would make your money back in less than a day. 

----

The dollar amounts next to each site are what I made in 2018.  Anyway, on to the revenue streams: 

----

**[Respondent.io](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11)** ([$4,300](https://imgur.com/a/oSpkC5o)): Studies - Most countries - This site allows users to screen for online or in-person surveys, interviews, and focus groups. The pay is amazing, easily averaging $125 per test. You take the qualification survey and if you score 100% on it you have about a 10% chance to get invited to take the survey by the coordinator. The site as a whole pays extremely well, but you have to fill out quite a bit of the qualification questionnaires to be invited to anything. I have personally filled out over 500 of them and have participated in about 40 actual surveys. It's more of a numbers game than anything else. Thankfully, each screener only takes me a few minutes to fill out and the pay for time invested is definitely worth it. I have made up to $300 with one hour of work doing an in person focus group. Most focus groups are done through webcam, so you don't even have to leave your house. They payout via PayPal 7 days after the activity is complete. 

----

**[SwagBucks](https://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=50837036)** ([$775](https://imgur.com/a/kwwoLyS)) Surveys ‚Äì Majority of countries‚Äì This is more of a catch-all for stuff to do when you want to make and save money. You can do surveys, play games, and watch videos to earn points. You can also get cash back from using SB to visit and buy from different stores. You get paid in points which can be used to purchase gift cards or sent directly to PayPal. Each point is the equivalent of $0.01. Usually, SB will have deals where you can get certain gift cards for less. For example, a $20 Amazon gift card for 1800 SB points. The payout can be slow, but if you don‚Äôt mind running ads in the background, using a plug-in to save money while you shop, or killing time playing a game, SwagBucks can be a great way to earn $20 a month.

----

**[Mturk](https://www.mturk.com)** ([$3,142](https://imgur.com/a/AhWXpuw)): Small tasks and surveys - US mainly. Confirmed also in Canada, Europe, &amp; Aus. - This is by far the one I spent the most time on and has been the best earner. This site lets humans perform small tasks that robots still cannot do well. It is owned by Amazon. Downside is there are slim pickings on weekends and when colleges are out on vacation. I typically stick to surveys, but once in a while do batch jobs which there are more of. You have to wait a week for your first payout, which will go to an Amazon payment account. You can the get payouts one time per day after that. Approval for mturk can sometimes be a pain in the ass, almost impossible if you are not from the US, but is definitely worth it in my opinion if you can get approved.

----

**[Secret shopper US](https://app.survey.com/account/merch?referral_code=roberthW77D)** and **[Secret shopper UK](https://uk.marketforceshopper.com/register)** ([$485](https://imgur.com/HfQ7PZw)): In-person store evaluation - US and UK only - These links will take you directly to a sign-up page. US version populates with my ref code. Feel free to delete it before signing up, if you want. You will be taken to the app store where you can download the actual app on your phone. Essentially, you go to stores near you that are identified in the app and take pictures or videos of specific items. I like this one because I have the ability to make a few extra bucks if I am already out shopping. The pay for this one averages about $15/hr. Note: I have not tried the UK version, but it was recommended by another Redditor. 

----

**[Usertesting](https://www.usertesting.com)** ([$800](https://imgur.com/a/ab5ptaN)): Website evaluation - US &amp; maybe select others - This site allows you to review new websites and apps. The pay is usually $10 per recorded test lasting 10-15 minutes. Sometimes the pay is more, but never less. I average a few tests a week. Some weeks I will get a dozen tests, other weeks nothing. This one is great to practice your feedback skills, which open up a lot of other doors. Pay is through PayPal, one week (to the minute) after the test is complete. 

----

**[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/7secondman)** ([$305](https://imgur.com/wobuyuz)) [25% off ref code for first order over $40](https://www.talkable.com/x/VznBIO): T-shirt creation - Worldwide - After getting rejected by merch by Amazon, I came here. You design and publish t-shirts, phone cases, and about 20 other mixed products, with each sell netting you a few bucks. They are based in Australia, and do pay-outs once a month on the 15th via PayPal. You do all of the uploading and just wait for people to find it with keywords or searches. Great if you are artistic or know how to use any creative software. 

----

**[Prolific.ac](https://www.prolific.ac)** ([$3,500](https://imgur.com/a/V8GXSTt)): Based in the UK, this used to be one of my favorites because they pay in Great British Pound (GBP) which is the equivalent to 1.25x the USD. Prolific is similar to Mturk (listed earlier) in that all you do is fill out surveys. Pay is better than Mturk, but the availability of surveys is not as great. In fact, I personally haven't seen a survey in months, but see others get them often. The initial questionnaire you have to fill out is a bit long taking me about 20 minutes, but ensures you qualify for every survey they show you and will never get disqualified for not meeting the demographic. You have to hit ¬£5 before you can cash out, but you get this after a few days of watching for surveys. Leave it open in a tab and check it throughout the day. I wish I could do this one all day because the pay rocks, but I only see a few a day. They pay out in PayPal anytime you request it and have a balance of over ¬£5. 

----

**[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com)** ([$190](https://imgur.com/a/SVhmvu5)): Selling goods - Worldwide - Not much explanation needed here. You buy stuff in-person low, and sell online high. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/eBay-Beginner-money-knowledge-inventory-ebook/dp/B07HT4Y9J6/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=ebay+for+beginners&amp;qid=1553285100&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-15) is a $2.99 beginner's guide dedicated to flipping that covers absolutely everything you need to know (also mine).

----

**[PlaytestCloud](https://www.playtestcloud.com/signup)** ($190): Video game testing - Many countries - This is just simple game testing. It is super fun, very quick, and you get to test new games before anyone else. They send you tests for different listed devices, you download the game file, and they record your screen and voice. The only issue I have with this one is that you are only able to test 3-4 games per month, at $9-$11 each. Paid almost immediately after each test via PayPal.

----

**[UsabilityHub](https://www.usabilityhub.com)** ([$15](https://imgur.com/a/U4FhJIQ)): App testing - Many countries - This one lets the user take quick one or two minute surveys on your opinion of an app screen. They pay for this averages to about $.10 a minute, so it is nothing spectacular. Just leave it open in another tab and take a quick survey when you hear a new one come available. 

----

**[UserInterviews](https://www.userinterviews.com)** ($50): Studies - US &amp; maybe select others - Similar to Respondent, but with less approval when filling out the demographics for each study.

----

**Product Testing** ($1,500): Mainly US &amp; some UK/CA - There are places online that will pay you to leave positive/negative reviews for companies or purchase products. This is actually a big business model in China and other S.E.A. countries. Personally, I already know that Amazon reviews, Yelp, BBB, and everything in the middle are at least half fake reviews; so I may as well monetize on it. If this is something that sounds interesting, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SuperSecretSpare/comments/cfoud7/manufactured_reviews/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) is more info. 

----

**Reddit subs**($2,300): It is super simple to use Reddit as more than a social media tool or news website. Knowing the right subs to subscribe to, and what to look for, can help you make a few extra hundred bucks  a month. There are a ton that you can find small or medium jobs on, but I am only going to outline the top four that have worked for me.

----

/r/slavelabour: This sub is normally dedicated to doing cheap jobs for people, at cheap rates. I have both had things done for me here, as well as completed a lot of tasks. It may seem daunting at first, with people offering $2 to write an essay (seriously though.. no homework here), but there are gems to be found. Two of my best jobs have been creating meal plans for $60, and [finding the name of a book for $80](https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/comments/92k4n0/task_find_one_of_my_favourite_books_80/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link).

----

/r/WOIncomeReports: A gold mine of information on different websites to check out, gift card survey opportunities, and other generally helpful tips. I have never made money directly from there, but have gotten tools that have helped make at least a thousand over the last year. This section used to be for the original Work Online sub, but that has deteriorated. 

----

/r/signupsforpay: Since slave labour does not allow paying people to sign up for websites, this is where to go to make a few bucks with signups. From connecting your gas and electric information, to signing up with Acorns, I have probably made a grand total of $100 here. Nothing overly special, but $100 is $100.  

----

/r/giftcardexchange: This is one of my favorites, because you can buy and sell all of those gift cards you have/want. Have a $20 gift card from a family member that you will never use? Sell it here for 80-90%. Want to buy Amazon gift cards for less than face value? Get 'em here. I do a lot of buying on Amazon, so this sub has easily saved me hundreds over the course of using it. Caution: Trade carefully. 

----

I know this is a lot of info, but I hope it helps!",/r/Agoraphobia/comments/fh244j/a_simple_guide_to_begin_working_from_home/
7,1583953096,lovehappinessSanity,There‚Äôs hope and I found my place,"I feel like this year has been full of an emotional rollercoaster. I‚Äôve been really emotional and more depressed. But every since I started my Ig recovery journey, I‚Äôve been consistent. I entered month 3 and I‚Äôve still been going to the gym. Something that is scary. I‚Äôve had setbacks like fevers and depersonalization (where when I get sick I start feeling not like myself and the world outside looks like it‚Äôs on fire and the world is ending and it truly convinces me the world is a scary page). I realized I‚Äôve been eating like shit and it reflects on my anxiety. It all caught up to me and instead of having setbacks, I‚Äôve been pushing to stay where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôve been driving a lot more. Maybe not too much but boy have I‚Äôve driven more this month than I have in the last 6. It‚Äôs amazing being able to wake up, share my thoughts/opinions, encouraging others to do so. I really think this was my thing. I really want people to push. There IS hope. Don‚Äôt be comfortable where you are at. Keep pushing. Really do this for yourself. And before anyone attacks me, it‚Äôs hard, it takes time but the first step is to want to get better that you agree to be comfortable with feeling uncomfortable. Any baby steps count. I‚Äôve had a trial an error, depression, suicidal thoughts, depersonalization, etc etc etc. And I want people to recover and not feel alone. As long as we live we deserve to make this life the best we can for ourselves. No matter how, do what you can to be happy. It‚Äôs so hard but it IS possible. Hopefully I recover and I get to show along the way to people that recovery isn‚Äôt a straight line. Sometimes I accomplish 18277282 things and it doesn‚Äôt even feel so good tbh. But don‚Äôt let that make you lose focus bc I didn‚Äôt realize those were the things that are keeping me here. Consistent. Doing better things and progressing. It won‚Äôt feel  like it at first because we‚Äôre so caught up on our agoraphobia. 
Keep fighting. If you guys need any helps, any tips don‚Äôt hesitate to message me. 
Although if you are very sensitive I cannot coddle you. I want to make people understand that it isn‚Äôt an easy job and although we are ALL brave for waking up and fighting our demons everyday, this change requires so much more. I want you guys to believe in yourselves as I have now. 
Also pls don‚Äôt be negative towards this post. This truth is uncomfortable but the happiness we achieve after is worth it. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to try. :) 
Thank you guys for all the support always.",/r/Agoraphobia/comments/fh2adp/theres_hope_and_i_found_my_place/

The anxiety and sheer agony of the wasted time is literally killing me. Ive thrown away my youth. I have no education, no career, no relationships and no prospects. Also no hope.

However, I will admit that I sighed audibly in emotional relief. Between being agoraphobic and having OCD, exposure was going to be incredibly challenging and panic-inducing tomorrow.

Unfortunately, logically and realistically I know this is not necessarily best for me in the long run and the lack of exposure will just compound until my doctor and I do meet again in person.

It's... _complicated._

I ordered some frozen rats online with the rest of my christmas money... she flipped out. she said i was avoiding the issue, and was really upset at me. i said at least i figured out a way to get my snake some food without having to destroy myself in a battle with my mind. i keep trying to tell her it‚Äôs not me not wanting to get a job, it‚Äôs not me being lazy, and it‚Äôs not leeching off her money (her words) it‚Äôs a literal diagnosis! she has bipolar I, she should understand. ‚Äúwell i wasn‚Äôt living with my parents when i was 17‚Äù, ‚Äúyour friend goes to school, your friend has a job, i went to school, i had a job‚Äù 

she just tears me down time after time. i think a part of this is not wanting to give her the credit if i move forward. if i get a job, she‚Äôs gonna think she‚Äôs such a wonderful mother for supporting her kid. fuck that. she doesn‚Äôt deserve any kind of credit, all she‚Äôs done is make me feel like even more of a worthless piece of shit than i already have my whole damn life. 

she‚Äôs said things like she‚Äôs gonna donate all the money she saved for me to a charity, she‚Äôs gonna kick me out because maybe it‚Äôll give me a wake up call, i should just move out because she dosent need people like me in her life.

29,1584078062,Grinfader,Anyone else with suspected or confirmed coronavirus?,"I might have been infected and it's tough but it could have been worse. How do you cope?

Bit of background:  I was doing great these last years, regaining a bit of confidence and autonomy. I could walk in a 20-30 minutes radius around home, alone, when the conditions were right. My daughter got pregnant and there were some complications there. I also had to move since the rent went way too high. Moving houses is very stressful for anyone, but of course it's worse for us: home is the safe place and moving is getting away from this sanctuary forever. 

These last 2 months, my panic attacks got way worse, and my autonomy suffered from this. I can't walk far anymore. My apartment is full of boxes, as the movers come next Tuesday. I haven't finished packing, but many of my comfort objects are in boxes and some even are already at the new place.

The COVID-19 panic hit me severely. I feared people wouldn't come to me if I needed help. I was very careful but I think I might have contracted the virus. I also suffer from asthma and high blood pressure, so I'm at risk even though I'm only 47.

I have some symptoms and feel trapped, doomed. It couldn't have happened at a worse time. My daughter just had her beautiful baby and she should be back from the hospital tomorrow. I am now isolated. I could ask to be tested for coronavirus, but there isn't any good reason to. Maybe I just have a regular flu/cough and going out would rise the risks of me getting infected (hospitals are full of viruses).

I'm coping by reading about life after death, NDE and such, and by writing a journal/letters for my relatives in case I don't make it through. I drink herbal teas mostly and some decaf. My anxiety levels are quite high, but I haven't panicked since before the first symptoms. Maybe because I now face actual danger rather than my usual imaginary ones. The symptoms are very mild, though. 

My move is compromised. I doubt I will be able to finish packing alone, and asking for help isn't advised with the virus risk.

I'm fearing death, of course, but as a good agoraphobic I think that I fear the trip more than the destination, if it makes sense. I fear I won't be able to cope with actual end-of-life symptoms. I've been saying I'm dying for 30 years, but now it feels like it could actually be it. At least, sane people will agree with me and recommend I stay home and don't come close to them‚Ä¶

I've been off work for about a month now, and that has probably made my agoraphobia (if that's what it is) worse, but it has alleviated some of my other anxiety.

I tend to not want to go anywhere. Actually, I dread going places. I did go into a grocery store the other day, so I'm not super confined, but the whole time I was panicking that someone I know might see me. Dreading small talk and judgement. Before lining up to check out I had to bail. I felt like I was suffocating with all the people, so I went out to the car, and got my husband to finish up and pay.

I also have a hard time going places on my own. I need someone with me in order to brave leaving the house.

I have ""comfort zone areas"". Anywhere outside of a half hour drive away is scary. Anywhere unknown is terrifying. I don't know how people can travel.

I have friends that always want me to do stuff with them and I'm constantly turning them down. I just feel safer and way less anxious in my home.

I also have avoidant personality disorder, ocd etc.  For avpd think social anxiety on steroids that never appears to go away. Anyways it all started a month ago after 4 years of not having a job, seriously never leaving my house and being terrified of both people and the outside world, I was sick of living this way. So I started out small and started volunteering at a food bank and non profit. I was severely terrified to do this, it was not easy. I felt like I was literally gonna die but I went and the owner seemed really nice. If I‚Äôm ever gonna get out of this mess I need references but above all I figured if I was gonna face my fears I may as well try and do some good. So every night I gotta be honest it‚Äôs not easy. My sleep is disturbed my stomach feels sick, but at the same time I haven‚Äôt been giving into this feeling which is easier said than done because our brains are literally screaming ‚Äúyou lunatic your gonna fucking die if you go out‚Äù but I just did it. Almost passing out when I walked out of my house so instead of driving I‚Äôve been using a driving service lol but I‚Äôve kept going.

I can leave my home alone, I can go for groceries alone, I can walk and take the bus alone, I can be in crowded places for a bit before panicking.

My province got its first confirmed cases today. Every single part of my brain is telling me to shut down and stay home and never leave. And the government is encouraging it!

It‚Äôs not so much that I‚Äôm afraid of getting sick, it‚Äôs me being terrified that I‚Äôll get my family sick.  One of the things I‚Äôve been doing since I‚Äôm better is helping take care of my 98 year old grandfather, and he wouldn‚Äôt survive if he got sick.

I feel you. It SUCKS! I was just on my second recovery as well, as I had backslid a lot due to some personal things that came up.

Let's try and look at it this way...

Maybe this whole ordeal is what we actually needed to help us get better. Right now there's a pretty good reason to be scared to go outside for once; unlike the myths and hypothetical scenarios that we create in our heads. Once we see this through, maaaaaaybe a much less Agoraphobic outlook will be waiting for us on the other side.

I think it's also important to keep in mind that while we should most definitely keep an air of seriousness about us, COVID-19 is not a death sentence for the majority of the population. What's happening right now is an attempt for the remaining countries of the world to not allow their healthcare systems to become overrun; as what happened in China, Italy, and Spain.

So let's just try and keep our heads up, think positive on this one, and see the possibility of coming out stronger once it's all said and done. Just think, when all this lets up so much tension and anxiety will be released from having to sanitize, disinfect, wash our hands, stay away from others, worry if someone else is carrying, etc. It'll make going out feel like a breeze!

Take care and stay safe everyone. Just remember to follow the new guidelines set in place in your location, chill out for a few weeks and be refreshed and ready to tackle your problems then. Right now, this is not about me, or you. It's about us, humanity, as a whole, getting through this as best we can. Personal problems should be put aside, this is a time of crisis. We need to be thinking of others as well.

I mean I do understand that most of these people may not be aware of what agoraphobia is / are just simply used to being occupied with their routines outside of their homes.

30,1584744738,agoraphobicrecluse,Something to share with your extrovert friends and family," 

Y'all are going to be holed up for a while so I thought I would throw a few tips together to make it a bit easier for you normies .  


  
1. Take your showers. Don't think that when you are sitting at home unwashed you don't stink. Do it for your loved ones or just do it for yourself. Negative ions are good for you and put you in a better frame of mind. Trust me (or fucking Google it).  


  
2. Get dressed. Pajamas everyday turn you into cat. Believe me, I know. Shit, break out those fancy clothes and get all gussied up. Put on your make up, do your hair, whatever. Have some fun with it.  


  
3. When you first wake up do what needs to be done before you do any fun stuff. Chores, learning, whatever. Get the shit out the way and you will appreciate the fun stuff later.  


  
4. Have regular meals. Not too many though. You are in a sedentary lifestyle now. Have at least one meal planned out and have a glorified snack later (or vice versa). Eating from boredom is a thing and now there is a lot of it.  


  
5. Pets. If you don't have any get some. Even if it's just a foster, shelters and rescues are in need of assistance especially now. If you already have pets here is a golden op to give them the extra attention they so deserve.  


  
6.  Speaking from a Gen X point of view, y'all have a world of information at your fingertips. For fucks sake you can access the Library of Congress. Do you know how much interesting shit is there? You have the unbelievable chance to learn whatever you have an interest in. Grab it, wallow in it. Enjoy.  


  
7. Play your music. It does sooth the savage beast when you are feeling ornery. Don't forget to dance. Always dance.  


  
9. Most importantly, we are so lucky we are able to keep in touch with each other remotely. Reach out. Talk with your friends and family. Reach out to strangers who might be struggling. Keeping contact with y'all has been one of things that has kept me going. I hope anything, what I have shared here, will keep you going .",/r/Agoraphobia/comments/fm4ido/something_to_share_with_your_extrovert_friends/

6,1584883591,PeacefulFriend,Short film help??,"Hello, I am a film student and since I am vulnerable to the coronavirus I have been quarantined at home. I still have to make a film though for my final project of the year.

I am making a psychological thriller about someone who is very lonely and as a result they develop hallucinations, but since I am in quarentine the entire thing has to be made in my house. I thought maybe giving my character agoraphobia would explain why they don't leave the house.

I do not, however, want to make my film offensive in any way to those who suffer from agoraphobia. If anyone would be happy to help me design my character in a way to make it as accurate and inoffensive as possible, that would be hugely appreciated. Side note: the hullucinations they experience will have nothing to do with their agoraphobia, it will be due to their loneliness and paranoia. 

The main things I want to make sure I get right are things like the avoidant behaviour, how they react to being unable to go out when they want to, and their loneliness (as this character is not going to have people around who understands or helps). Please let me know of you would be happy to help, but please look after yourself and don't help me if you think it will trigger your own symptoms.

Luckily thinks are just scraping by so that I'm in a hotel not on the street (I'm super terrified of going n the street as I have grand mal seizures and have had a stroke and am female and a SA survivor and I will freak out (to say the least) from being unsafe if I have to sleep rough in a city because of assaults, I'm also not eligible for housing..... so this is fun. I've also been hallucinating weird things because my pain isn't being treated atm. I'm also hallucinating from pain and it is sometimes hard to know what is my mind screwing with me  


Anyway the latest place I'm in has a grocery store RIGHT next door so I go out almost every day (progress!) to get fresh salad fixings (eating healthy while I can) but today it was really hard, it went ok in the store even though some of the things I wanted to get weren't left on the shelf cause of hoarders   


So I was leaving and I decided to get an apple turnover and they were closing and the guy had already cashed out his bank card reader and rung in the purchace and I didn't have cash and he was like ""it's ok you can pay me later"" and I started to panic because small buisnesses need every purchace and I'd have to remember and pay while he was on the shift so he'd know how to ring it in and I just started getting really racing thoughts and shaky and thought my legs were going to give way and sweat was developing on my forehead  but I noticed an ATM so I was able to get out the money- I mean he was being nice but I HAD to do it or else I wouldn't be able to walk by then anymore (I know people here will get this) so I was able to get him the cash finally and I was already sweating from the anxiety by that point.... UGH  


Then I was all shaky and my groceries fell off my walker when I was trying to lift everything up the couple stairs at the entrence and my oranges and onion rolled everywhere but at least the bottle of olive oil didn't break and spill and make a super dangerous spill on the granite out front  


That is the most boring excitement I've had in a while - how did I become such a WUSS, I used to deal with such hardcore things at many jobs ugh lol

2,1585232999,jenvonlee,Meds Dilemma,"Hi! I'm pretty much a pro agoraphobe.. haven't left the house unaccompanied in about 15 years and that's usually only once every few weeks or so for very small trips. So staying put due to this virus isn't a problem. I do however have absolutely crippling health anxiety, when this first erupted I literally didn't get out of bed for 4 days for fear of it just being 'in the air'. No open windows, nothing.

I'm trying really hard to push on. Exercising more indoors, putting myself on a strict sleep schedule etc. But there's a problem looming I don't know how to handle. I'm on various meds, for psychosis and depression etc. In 2 weeks i'll have to pick up a repeat prescription. Problem is the person that usually accompanies me no longer can, I have nobody that can pick it up for me and theres no possibility I can even get there let alone stand in those lines without becoming a wailing puddle on the floor. 

I've seen delivery services but none are accepting. Can't find anyone offering to do these runs in my area. So it looks like my only option is to wean myself off of them in 2 weeks and hope I don't just completely lose my mind. I'm just not sure how to do it because one of the meds I take is a single tablet that's sustained release. But I'm warned it's highly dangerous to just stop it because it can lead to major heart problems.

3,1585247996,Galacticsurveyor,Unpopular opinion (This sub should not be a place for people to be comfortable about having agoraphobia and not fighting it),"I followed this sub a while ago, and left because it was a bunch of people freaking out. I‚Äôm one of you. I‚Äôve had it for going on 10 years. Like most of the posts I‚Äôve seen, I also had basically given up. 

Don‚Äôt give up! Omg, about a month ago, I had some clarity; I did a lot of reading about exposure therapy. 

You don‚Äôt have to feel like this forever. I‚Äôm going to go over a few things that most of you probably know. 

Going somewhere fast and getting what you needed and leaving without a panic attack isn‚Äôt a success in helping treat your agoraphobia. I used to be so proud of when that would happen. All you‚Äôre doing is telling your brain that you‚Äôre safe If you leave quickly. 

Exposure therapy should be done somewhere that makes you uncomfortable about a 5. (Look up SUDS) you could go hire but that would be flooding and most likely cause you to 1. Not do it again. 2. Not stay the right amount of time. 
You need to stay at your spot until you get down to a 1-2. This is relatively comfortable. When you leave, you should feel kind of bored of being there. 

Do not do exposure therapy based on time. I‚Äôll go to ______ for 15 minutes. This will trick your body into thinking you‚Äôre safe for that amount of time. Stay where you are struggling until it goes down. It‚Äôs hell. I know. You are going to feel like you‚Äôre dying or going insane. 
Only the first few times... I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôll just feel better at that place. Doing exposure therapy makes doing exposure therapy everywhere easier. 

Go into your exposure therapy not trying to fight it. Go into as a battle. You got your breathing. Muscle techniques? Water to splash on your face? Whatever it is that helps you. 

STAY THERE UNTIL YOUR PANIC GOES DOWN. 
If you leave your exposure therapy before your calm, you failed. I don‚Äôt mean this rude. It happens to me. It‚Äôll happen to you. But we are trying to rewire our brain. If you live early your body now thinks where you left is dangerous. You just added fuel. 

I know this is a lot and a bit of rambling but I spent a long time thinking my life would be shit. Since starting my exposure therapy I‚Äôve had about the same amount of panic attacks and overall anxiety as I normally do. Main difference is I‚Äôm controlling them. Eventually they will be far and in between. 


Brothers and sisters, we got this. I want to see more posts saying I conquered my exposure exercise and less ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt have to leave home.‚Äù

7,1585291991,MallowMouth,People Worrying About Their Progress,"[Long Post Warning]

The last couple of days I've been really stressed, because I have gone from years at a time of not going out, shaking just looking at the door handle, feeling nauseous just taking out the trash... To holding down small part time jobs, enjoying going for walks, going to buy groceries almost every single day, even taking the bus into the next town. 

I did a bunch of thinking about it, though, and I came up with some ways to (at least somewhat) safeguard my recovery and soothe my mind. 

I must stress that I am not a therapist, and that these are simply things that work for me that I'm sharing in the hopes that they'll help someone else in a similar situation. If you have any to add that work for you, please do comment! 


. Make a list of things you enjoyed and miss about being able to go outside, even if they're 'small' things like ""having the freedom to buy what I want from the store"" or ""seeing people go about their normal lives"".

. Make a list of goals; things you wanted to do in your recovery, things you were looking forward to being able to do. Maybe even things you had to cancel or give up doing for the foreseeable future. ""When all this blows over I want to join that book club"" for example. 

. Write down how far you've come (turn it into a mood board or scrap book or something fancy if you like, that's therapeutic too!). Note all the things that had become relatively easy for you before the quarantine, how much less fear you felt doing them. 

. If you're in any kind of therapy, or have been, do not give up on it. Continue your CBT exercises, fill out a diary for your therapist, practice your breathing techniques. 

. Spend some time in your garden if you have one. Gardening is a good one right now! Step out onto your balcony or porch or front lawn if it's safe to do so. Make sure you're not lacking in air or sunlight again, and reduce the ""door-phobia"".

. Talk to people who don't have this phobia, really listen to them and try not to judge them. Hear why they miss being outdoors, maybe even make tentative plans together. Right now you both have a legitimate reason to be afraid, and there's no better time to gain understanding of each other. Try not to isolate too much. 

. Practice general self-care. There's nothing you can do to change this situation right now, but you can change how you feel about it and how strong you are in the face of it. Use that nice bubble bath or bottle of wine you've been saving. Washing your hands a whole lot? Remember to lather on the moisturiser. Buy yourself a small treat if you can afford it: a new blanket, an oil burner or diffuser, that game you've been wanting to play, an online course you've been eyeing. Try meditation (free trial of Headspace??), rewatch your favourite childhood movie, write an old-fashioned love letter.

At least I have income right now. But all I want to do it puzzles in pajamas with my cat and not even have to consider going outside. God damn it. Thank you for reading my rant.

11,1585410371,peeblejeebles,Im Spiraling Thanks To My Job,"I‚Äôm a full time grocery store stocker. Believe me, if I lived in an area where working from home was feesible I‚Äôd do it and not have to be in the position I‚Äôm in. I was diagnosed with agoraphobia last year, and my job is literally the only time I leave my house. For a while I felt like the exposure therapy due to my job was slowly starting to help... 

And then the coronavirus happened. 

It‚Äôs in my state, and surrounding counties. The only reason mine doesn‚Äôt have any reported cases is because we are incredibly rural and it has been said by the sheriff that we have no tests at all in the county. It‚Äôs here, it‚Äôs just unreported. 

And being a grocery worker the past few weeks have been hard. No one is listening to stay at home precautions or six feet apart social distancing. My anxiety is becoming unbearable and I‚Äôve had multiple panic episodes in the past two weeks to the point my bosses know about it now. 

There‚Äôs a knot in my stomach that makes me nauseous the moment I leave my house to come here. I‚Äôm tense as hell for nine hours straight, trying to dodge people and my voice cracking with anxiety when I ask them to give me space. People look at me like I‚Äôm crazy. I probably am at this point honestly. 

I want to quit and stay home where it‚Äôs safe, but all my insurance is tied to my job. No time off is being approved either, and though I do have four sick days if I use them they count against me in my six month evaluation. I‚Äôm getting no hazard pay or compensation of any kind. Nearly all of our part timers quit bc of the virus so if I bail things will be even harder for my coworkers...

This is the third time in two hours I‚Äôve had to run to the bathroom to stop myself from crying. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to keep going without losing my shit.",/r/Agoraphobia/comments/fqmkcf/im_spiraling_thanks_to_my_job/

about me: 27/M/Canada. i love metal music + other genres, art, various genres of TV/film, mostly old-school gaming, nature/pets and a bunch of other stuff. i've been struggling with agoraphobia since 2013, i also deal with depression and social anxiety.

15,1585499694,UnsettledSleeper,I need help. I'm not eating.,"Earlier this week I was up late and tried to fall asleep and it didn't happen. I got hungry and had a couple bowls of cereal. After which I quickly became anxious. Maybe it was the fact that I was tired and so my ability to control my anxiety was lower, I don't know, but I freaked out about putting something in my body I couldn't get out. I tried throwing up and couldn't make myself do it. Which only made things worse. Because then I felt even more trapped and also ashamed I tried to do that. Ultimately nothing bad happened other than two hours of heightened anxiety/panic and trying to distract myself from it with other things until I could fall asleep.

The next day (rather later that day) I only ate a few slices of salami and a little pasta salad. Same the next day but also added three quarters of a hot dog. The day after that I had a few slices of salami and a half a slice of corn bread with butter and freaked out again. This time calling the suicide prevention hotline because I needed someone to talk to (first time I've ever done that) and also drove myself to my doctors office. Yesterday I didn't eat at all because I was up all night and day trying to reset my sleep cycle and didn't want to eat while I was tired. For fear I would freak out again. I told myself that today I would eat. But I really didn't. I had about five or six small spoonfuls of chicken broth. That's it.

I should also mention I'm an agoraphobic, so I can't go far from home. All of my anxiety issues revolve around a fear of being trapped or more specifically, not being able to get out of a situation fast enough. This is the same. But this is a much bigger problem, because if I don't eat, I die. So it has me really worried and really feeling weak.

Does anyone have any suggestions for me? This feels like such a stupid thing to be anxious over. I wish it would just go away. I'm 41 and never had this problem.

TLDR: I'm not eating because I'm anxious about putting something in my body I can't get it back out if I want. Need suggestions to overcome this.",/r/Agoraphobia/comments/fr8nqm/i_need_help_im_not_eating/

I‚Äôm traumatised as a result, suffering from suspected C-PTSD.

(Emetophobia is an extreme fear of all things related to throwing up) I'm still just learning about agoraphobia, but for me I hate being in situations where I feel like I can't escape, but it's different to claustrophobia, because I can handle small spaces as long as I feel like I can escape. I hate big meetings and I always scope out the nearest exit. I always feel like I have to be close to a door. I don't like being in situations that are out of my control. Does anyone understand this?

This was the only thing I could do.

&amp;#x200B;

I have accepted the fact that I will FOR SURE lose a lot of my progress during the pandemic, that is unavoidable. But there is nothing I can do about that and I have simply stopped worrying about it.

You should do the same because **setback is unavoidable.** Agoraphobia is relentless and recovery form it requires extraordinarily commitment. Even skipping a SINGLE day always had an effect on me in the terms of apprehension anxiety and anxiety in general. 

This shit has barely started and it is going to do a lot of damage to must of us here.

**I am not advocating that you should go out and risk infecting yourself or anyone else, it's for you to decide weather it is SAFE or NOT to go for a walk.**

For me, it is. During those 7 days I have probably meet less than 10 people in total during my walks.

I am posting this in an attempt to motivate you to do your best during those difficult times.

Basically, there is nothing else to do but accept the fact that recovery is currently on hold.
