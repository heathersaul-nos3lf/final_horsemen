0,OTOT4,Exposure therapy for integrating back into the community,"Hey all! I came across this page by accident and I’m glad I did. I spent a while reading different posts (ranging from people who feel like they don’t have a desire to go out again, to those who are running out the doors once we are COVID-19 free).  As an Occupational therapist, I work with a lot of people with anxiety. One common thing a lot of my clients have been telling me is how their mood has improved since COVID-19 has begun.  That’s almost the complete opposite from what people in my everyday life would report. When I ask them why they feel better, they begin to tell me it’s because they are no longer being forced to get back out there and engage with others/run errands/attend appointments in person.

While COVID-19 may feel like a vacation to some (or a death sentence to others), I would suggest developing habits to ensure you have an easy transition when things go back to “normal”.  I know a lot of us believe that “normal” will not look like what it did before, but there will still be some expectation to leave the home once in a while.  I genuinely feel worried that people will fall deeper and deeper into the idea that home is safety and the world is a dangerous place.

If you are finding yourself being more fearful of the world each passing day, I encourage you to take small steps when getting back out there. With any goal, make sure it’s SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time sensitive). So instead of making a goal that I will go out more, try to make a more specific one like:
1) I will sit on my porch Monday afternoon for 10 minutes
2) I will drive to the Walmart parking lot across the street, and sit in my car while I people watch for 10 minutes

None of what I’m saying is exactly earth shattering. But by making SMART goals and exposing yourself to the community in small steps, you’ll find the transition back into society a bit more manageable each day. 

Just thought I’d share my 2 cents. 

Good luck everyone.",2020-05-13 20:23:02,/r/COVID19_support/comments/gjbfr3/exposure_therapy_for_integrating_back_into_the/

2,PlayfulTitan18,Hey everyone I thought I would give an update on how my mental health is going.,"So I made a post a while back about how this pandemic has been effecting my mental health. Sadly it hasn't gotten any better. I know people have said some kind words and have tried to get me to cheer up and for that I am grateful. I can't help but still worry and have more mental break downs over this pandemic.  


I don't think I have ever had anything this bad before aside from my fear of dying alone. Thankfully I do have someone very dear to me in my life that I love and care for. She has easily been one of the best things to have ever happened to me and I never take our love for granted. Life was looking up with her in my life and looking to get a job that would allow us to get a place together. Now that has halted due to the pandemic. We used to love to go to the mall together that won't happen again or won't be the same. I get upset whenever I go out and look around seeing people wearing a mask. Sure I get that it's to keep other people safe which is 100% fine and expected. It's just the more I see people walking around in them is a constant reminder that things aren't the same anymore.  


Not to mention people bring up the fact that after this is over there will be a ""new normal"" and that doesn't make me feel better it makes me feel more anxious. Will the ""new normal"" mean I will still have to stay away from being able to see my friends and family? Does the ""new normal"" mean everywhere I go I will see people in face masks for the long term future? Does it mean that going to events, concerts, etc. will be even more hectic because there will be even more protocols in place for attending?  


That alone is just a small sample of what goes through my mind. When I don't worry about those things for a brief moment I think about how life was when we could go to all these wonderful places, events, concerts and traveling to different places. Whenever I think of how good we used to have it that makes me the most upset. Being able to see a movie with friends and family, traveling with the girlfriend to events that we loved to attend to, enjoying my time with my friends doing whatever we wanted to, etc. Just all these thoughts is what I think about day in and day out and honestly I don't know what to do about my feelings anymore. I write on here to let it all out and to let other people know how I am personally handling this pandemic and I am sure I am not the only one out there who is feeling the same way. Bottom line is that I am really starting to think this whole thing has got me to the point where my mental health won't go back to where it was even with there being a ""new normal"".",2020-05-13 21:34:11,/r/COVID19_support/comments/gjcmkn/hey_everyone_i_thought_i_would_give_an_update_on/
3,Old_boy7,Anyone else have upset stomach as the primary symptom?,"I should preference I never got tested. About 3 and a half weeks ago I got diarrhea that lasted for a week, with what felt like low grade fever, nasal congestion, and fatigue. Cleared up after about two weeks. However, I went for a run after eating dinner on Monday and wince then I've had a lingering upset stomach and real bad acid reflux. I haven't gotten enough sleep lately, but still. This is strange bug. I've never had a bug I thought i was over and then it came back, but it's happened multiple times with this. Anyone else had a similar time?

4,rendervelvet,Navigating Extended Family and Social Distancing/Boundaries,"I (mid 30s) am currently sharing a household with an elderly parent (late 60s, no underlying health issues).  For the first two months of lock-down we were very quarantined, with a monthly grocery trip being the greatest chance of exposure.

After 2 months we decided to open up to my sibling who has 2 small children.  Working from home and being a full time day care was too much for the parents to handle and it doesn't look like things are going to go back to normal for a very long time.

I help babysit and the kids also go to their other grandparents house.  So essentially we're 3 separate households that have combined.

One of the grandparents recently went to the hospital for a non-COVID-19 issue (they tested negative) and spent 2 days at the hospital.  They're home now and the kids will resume going to their place.

I am concerned about the chance they might have been exposed to the virus during their hospital stay.  My sibling and their in-laws don't seem bothered by this or feel a need to quarantine first.

Before we started seeing the kids too, our chances of being exposed to the virus were very slim.  My parent takes this very seriously and actually started worrying back in Feb well before most of the world.  By merging with two other households I feel like our chance of exposure went up significantly.  This hospital trip feels like the boundary keeps getting pushed a little more each time.

There seems to be so many people that are asymptomatic or get very mild flu symptoms.  But I also see articles of otherwise healthy people in their 30s, 40s and 50s having severe illness or death.  I can't tell if I am being over-reactive to say I won't see them for 2 weeks.  It has been nice to see the kids and I know they need more interaction and playtime which I'm happy to offer.  

If I do decide to stop seeing them for 2 weeks they'll tolerate the decision but think we're being overly cautious and judge us behind our backs.  I don't like being put in a position where trying to make safe cautious choices makes me appear snobby, cold or overreactive.  And maybe nothing would happen and he didn't get the virus at the hospital.  It's impossible to say.

I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice on the matter!",2020-05-13 22:24:25,/r/COVID19_support/comments/gjdfb9/navigating_extended_family_and_social/

7,genius_username_,My mom will not stop leaving the house,"I don't know what to do at this point. She has gone out for unnecessary trips (multiple grocery stores in one day, hardware stores, my grandma's, etc.) about 6-7x a week for the past 3 weeks. Today she went to 4 different places, most notably the vet with my 3 dogs to get their nails clipped... aka something we could definitely do in our house. I'm so paranoid now that she is going to give it to my immunocompromised brother &amp; dad. I feel like she's being so selfish but she will not listen to anything I say and refuses to stay in – but then she'll chastise those protesting lockdowns (the irony lol).

I feel like I'm spiraling. I'm afraid to even touch my dog since he has been to the vet.. can the virus live on animal fur?",2020-05-13 23:47:21,/r/COVID19_support/comments/gjeool/my_mom_will_not_stop_leaving_the_house/
8,broadwaybabyto,If you HAD to go to the hospital would you feel comfortable? How to manage that anxiety?,"Ok guys ... if you absolutely HAD to go to an urban hospital that you knew had COVID cases how would you prepare? Obviously I know medical PPE needs to be for the employees - but what kinds of DIY stuff would you use? 

I’ve been avoiding the hospital like crazy but I’m very ill (non-COVID) and the doctors really want me to come in for urgent tests. They are taking a LOT of precautions with me but I’m still really worried about going and so I want to take my own precautions as much as possible. Or I may not go. I’m trying to prepare as best as I can including ensuring I have supplies so I don’t need to buy/eat/drink anything while I’m there. 

I’m trying to make a pro/con list. My city locked down early &amp; aggressively and so all my tests &amp; appts were cancelled even though I was considered “urgent”... so at this point there’s been an 8 week delay in my care and the doctors are concerned enough to want to bring me in and I’m having a hard time justifying delaying any longer due to “anxiety”. But the anxiety is also very severe. 

I also haven’t left my house at all for 8 weeks. Which is a privilege (ie that I’m able to do that &amp; get deliveries etc) but also a curse as I’m becoming almost agoraphobic. 

I would appreciate any tips. I know for 14 days after I go I’m going to have a huge uptick in anxiety but I have to balance that with the regret I will feel if I end up dying because I’m too stubborn to go for care :(. Anyone else been through this?

So far the cons are pretty obvious - risk of exposure and/or risk of such an increase in anxiety that I end up with severe issues from that. Anxiety is very bad for my pre-existing condition and it can be life threatening. 

Pros include the chance to get in for tests before we start to re-open at which point there will be a LOT more patients. Right now there are very few patients and they are taking a lot of precautions. Also there’s still enough attention given to COVID that anyone I pass while out will hopefully also be taking precautions. Most importantly it will hopefully help us explain why I’ve been so sick and if it’s something treatable then perhaps I can start feeling better 🤷‍♀️. 

Finally - I figure going in might help my agoraphobia. It’s so severe now and my health is suffering from lack of physical activity and fresh air (I live in a 500 square foot condo with no balcony). I think if I can survive the stress of a hospital visit I will likely be able to be comfortable with things like going for a walk or a drive ... and that would really help me.

My tentative PPE plan would include a mask with filter (that I already have due to my other condition), gloves, a hairstyle and hair covering that keeps my hair from touching anything as I have very long hair. Possibly sunglasses as I don’t have goggles. I will be sure to stay 6 feet from anyone and if possible avoid using the washroom or eating /drinking while I’m out. 

Thanks everyone - I’m embarrassed by how scared I am but I hope this is the right place to discuss it.",2020-05-13 23:50:28,/r/COVID19_support/comments/gjeqbq/if_you_had_to_go_to_the_hospital_would_you_feel/

15,muffinpuncher615,I genuinely think I’m depressed,"I am a high school senior right now and this virus is destroying everything that I held dear to me. Everything that made me happy is gone and it’s eating away at my future. I lost my high school graduation, my grad night, and a grad party. Most importantly to me personally thougy was I lost my prom. Going into high school, I already planned my promposal and I missed my junior prom because I was at my sister’s college graduation. But it was ok because as a senior, I had a girlfriend, I had an in with somebody who was gonna let me take their Porsche, it was gonna be an awesome night in the city and I had been talking about it for months. They aren’t even going to reschedule. I lost it. It’s gone. I never had a high school prom. And I can deal with that but what gets me the most is I saw my girlfriend every single day. Each and every day and I loved it. We’ve been dating for a year but we were friends long before and it feels like it’s even been longer. Now I can’t see her nearly as much. We break the rules and do something every week or two but I miss her all the time. My only solice was in the hope that this summer would be better and then we would be going to a similar area for college and I could see her maybe every other weekend. Now, summer is gonna be under lockdown too and guess what?! The college I am going to is all online first semester and hers isn’t... we are going to have to go the entire first semester without seeing each other. She’s gonna go meet new people and have new experiences while I just sit home and stay here without her. We’re strong but it’s not like we’re engaged or something rn and most high school relationships that end in college end then... so then I’m gonna be here, without my friends, without my girlfriend, with no activities to be able to help me take my mind off of things and I’d still have to be in college classes. I used to go on hikes alone and sit and look over my city to help but I can’t do that anymore either because all of the parks are closed. Idk what to do. I don’t see any joy rn. I want to enjoy what I have with my girl before she goes but everytime I even see her name I get really sad knowing that she has to leave and likely won’t come back to me. Nobody that I know has had to break up because of distance and I can’t even think of any good things to do rn. I’m just... depressed. I’m not sure what posting here is gonna do but I wanted to tell somebody. Thanks for those of u who read all the way down to here. I know everybody has their own struggles rn. But this is mine.

17,RoundaboutFlare,Trinkets,"I stand in the kitchen,  
a brief pause in my daily pacings,  
having neither worked up an appetite  
nor sated the worries in my head.  
But I stop at the fridge, again, once more again  
addicted to eating my feelings,  
gobbling them up in huge chunks  
of homemade sourdough bread  
and stocked meat to outlast the factory shutdowns.  
Maybe there'll be gaps in the supply chain,  
maybe there won't.  
Maybe I'll wake up some day and this  
will all have been a fever dream,  
and the Beforetimes will spring back  
alive again, like they never left us.  
Maybe they won't.  
Maybe I need to stop thinking of all the maybes.  


Today, I eat.  


Pink was once the new black,  
now stress eating is the new pants.  


For just a moment though,  
my hand pauses on the fridge door handle,  
my eyes locked on the collage of souveniers  
of the normal times we left long ago.  


I take the trinkets in like something foreign,  
peering over old movie tickets and invitations,  
photos of New Year's Eves, weddings, baby showers  
Friends all smiling, friends all together  
When we could gather with no thought of death or disease or virus or numbers--  
Magnets from places that seem like they're a universe away  
Someplace I once lived that is closed off to me now  
Cass Railroad, South of the Border  
Shenandoah National Park,  
Independence Hall,  
How I long to visit the english daisies and marigolds  
of Hershey Gardens once again, photos aren't good enough  
photos don't warm you face in the sun or bring you back to the scent  
of an eden hidden in the mountains of Pennsylvania  
They just remind me of better long ago days  
I miss the times of easy travel, just jump in the car and go.  
Florida, Maine, South Carolina, Virginia postcards  
all decorate the white bareness of my fridge with stinging reminder  
of all the places I can't return to until this passes over,  
until we're all free of this nightmareish new normal.  
A smiling tiki god stares at me from a Disney's Polynesian magnet,  
I wonder if Cinderella's castle misses me...  
A Fright Lane pass from King's Dominion is tacked to the cork,  
Two years ago, haunted houses were scary.  
Now, we're living where everything is terrifying.  
Tickets scattered and pinned,  
Smithsonian Museum, Virginia Aquarium, Woodford Reserve  
where I could drink bourbon and then go look at all the pretty little Kentucky horses  
Colonial Williamsburg, Luray Caverns  
general admissions to tours and sights to see  
when there still were sights to see  
and not just four bare walls to hold me in.  
Now, I vacation in my living room, travel to my bedroom and summer in my closet  
and wonder if I will ever return to wild summer road trips  
getting junk food at the gas stations that we passed through  
looking at the exit signs as they flew by and classic rock played  
wind in my hair, arm out the window, free and full of life--  
when the road called to me and I could join it's song.  


I pause there.  
And I remember.

18,slobberingapparition,Mom needs me but everyone else is sure I'm going to get sick.,"Hey hello hi I'm bad at starting these so I'll cut to the chase. I live a pretty long distance from my mom with my fiance. My mom is disabled and having surgery on her hip soon. She desperately needs/wants me to come visit so I can help around the house and fix a few things around the house for her. She's even already bought the plane ticket and put it off for months due to concerns, but now the flight is next month.

I want to go. I know my mom needs me right now. My fiance on the other hand is terrified that I'm going to get sick and not recover. Not that it really matters but I'm 25 and could be in better shape healthwise (i need to exercise honestly, that would settle most of my problems). I don't know what to do, honestly. I'm completely torn by this and I'm not sure what to even do. 

I've been self-quarantining since mid March, only going out to get food from drive-thru places. I've been washing my hands and wearing face masks and doing everything I can to stay safe. I know planes are taking great precautions to keep people safe right now, but I don't know! I just don't know.

I am not in the slightest attempting to minimalize the situation, I know very well the dangers. I just basically want an outside person to nudge me a little and give me some insight as to what would be right in this situation, I guess?

tl;dr: I have a plane ride in a month to see my mom who needs me to fix her house for her before surgery. My fiance thinks I'm going to die. What should I do?",2020-05-14 10:13:47,/r/COVID19_support/comments/gjn4q7/mom_needs_me_but_everyone_else_is_sure_im_going/

20,LowraAwry,Anxious taking in-person vocal lessons again.,"This is probably so insignificant compared to all the shit going down. But... here I am.

Where I live, the lockdown has eased the past weeks (with good reason since apparently we got a good start and we seem to have things under some control). One of the businesses that open again are music classes at local spots; I was taking vocal classes at one of those. I was glad some few months ago when they closed because singing (involves spitting etc) in a small room with students coming in and out and my teacher being in close contact with all of us, stressed me out.

Thing is, these issues haven't been resolved. Covid19 is here to stay. The classrooms are still small. In summer, we usually turn on AC units but this is also dangerous now. We generally have to keep any windows closed so that we do not bother the residents around us.  Very importantly, and I don't know whether other people who sing for hobby or work worry too about this, Covid19 can have a very serious impact on the respiratory system.  3 years ago I had  laryngitis and bronchitis which turned to asthmatic bronchitis. It SUCKED BALLS. I lost my voice for a week and was unable to sing for a year. My whole body was weak for at least 8 months. It took 2 years of work to strengthen my voice to a point I was even better than before. I don't want to lose this again.

Also I have seen no income these past months and it is unsure when I will be able to work again to be able to afford the classes. I am scared that my teacher (coach, whatever) will drop me but I guess I should better discuss this with her before having such worries. Then again, if I don't take classes now, during summer, then when? Autumn? Winter? We're talking about a second wave of covid19 but also, flu season.

I just.....I don't even know. Skype classes aren't very common around here and I don't believe they help as much as in-person ones. Singing is lots of things from posture to everything else. And it will require some equipment if we want to be able to have a good skype lesson. But it's worth looking into and discussing it. I used to think that singing classes are like therapy and cost less. It was true.

Is anyone facing something similar? There are other arts like dancing.... when dancing studios/academies are given the green light how will you react? I just wanted this out there.

This might be the only place where I am allowed to suggest we might be creating a world that is not worth living in, not just for the duration of the pandemic but for a generation of people's lifetimes. And those who have reason to be this scared of the virus know they will not have to face the consequences so they don't really seem to care.

People in their late 30s, 40s and 50s have families, and are more likely to have a job that is still continuing to pay them. People in their 20s and early 30s are more likely to live alone, have little support, and have less stable finances with student debt, few assets and little savings. University-aged people have the choice to drop out, or to rack up student debt for online courses that will probably not be as highly valued in workplaces after this. School-aged kids will see a huge gap in their critical learning years.

I'm in my mid 20s, and am lucky enough to still have a job. Since school, I pretty much checked out socially for reasons largely outside of my control. I tried to develop a stoic attitude and work on self-improvement, but there was a specific timeline of about 6 years that I figured the situation was going to last for. This was going to be the year I restarted my life, but now I think it's not a matter of waiting a bit longer but rather re-evaluating what kind of goals are worth having.

I'm single and live alone in a city I moved to a year ago, and don't know a lot of people here. I was really hoping in the next few years I would get married, start a family and buy a house, but I'm practically ready to give up on those things and become a high-functioning alcoholic. I feel like all I want is a tolerable normal life, one that all my predecessors took for granted. And one that they are willing to take away from me without a second thought. I realize many people have it worse than me, and I am sympathetic to them, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for somebody who has already had the chance to watch their children grow up in prosperity and have children of their own.

The more information that comes out about the virus, the more it would suggest that the only people who face a serious risk are those who could self-isolate easily. And yet I hear stories from my area about seniors in homes holding dances even when they knew they had an outbreak. I understand their mentality: many don't want to live forever and have made their peace, so they would rather dance for another day than live for another year.

But I'm getting to a point where I can hardly handle another day. I don't see much chance of avoiding a full-blown second Great Depression, I don't think any legitimate scientists believe we will have a vaccine for several years if ever, and pretty soon things will open just enough to ensure a barely tolerable existence but avoid starvation and riots. That opening will mean most people will get the virus, and there will be nothing they can do about it, and sadly many of the vulnerable will die. In the end, I don't think lockdown will have saved really any lives, but it will have succeeded in ruining many. And all this is assuming they don't start another world war over it (which is coincidentally what it took to climb out of the Great Depression).

I feel like by the time this is over I will have missed the boat, lost my youth and my future, and maybe by that time stopped caring anymore.",2020-05-14 19:45:38,/r/COVID19_support/comments/gjy1a6/its_getting_hard_not_to_give_up_hope/
