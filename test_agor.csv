3,1494029665,MorallyConfusedZora,I found a job. (I'm not happy about it),"Hi... so I got a job today. My depression has kicked in very bad now about it. 

See, I don't really want to work. It's not because I'm lazy or dislike the idea of working, it's that I don't see a point. I'm pretty mentally fucked up (PTSD, Dissociative Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, ect ect) which makes doing nearly anything a massive difficulty, then on top of that I'll be working for minimum wage trying to get out of an abusive house, then I feel like my life is going to be completely over once I move into full time, hell, I feel like it will on part time.. I'll have no free time at all, and when I do, I'll have to save my money and worry about work, sleep schedules (that I can't keep, mental health loves to keep me up at night), figuring out how to get into college, and then dealing with my issues in a productive way, no time for myself at all to relax, something I've literally NEVER been able to do.

I'm also rather upset because this was just a rage-apply to a place I didn't even want to work at because my mother decided to call me a liar about a fucking headache (???) and then tried to kick me out of the house when I tried to combat it. Like, I didn't even want this job to begin with, I was just a suicidal fuckwad and applied in desperation to get out of the house, but now I have the job and have to deal with it.

I'm just venting about how fucking pointless I feel like getting a job is if I won't have any security from it and no free time at all. I've been abused all my life and this is what I get, more impossible work and an even bigger lack of security. Fuck your relaxation and mental state, I guess.",/r/depression/comments/69ibs0/i_found_a_job_im_not_happy_about_it/

But when I bring it up the people around me either don't want to discuss it or basically say get over it. 

I guess that's what the hotlines are for. I used a chat for suicide prevention but it wasn't really helpful to me in regards to helping me feel better. 

I wish I could just build up the courage to end it. I've been thinking about it almost everyday for awhile now but can't seem to make myself go through with it. ",/r/depression/comments/69ic6s/they_say_talk_to_someone_about_it_but_no_one/

6,1494030331,yaoikin,My friend makes me want to kill myself,"I'm in my late teens and some of my friends make my depression much worse. Some of them are nice but there's this one that constantly says hints about me like I'm ugly and I'm not smart and I have no friends. Today someone in not in the friend group asked me to go to an event with her and I said okay and when I told my friends I was going she gave me a mean smile and basically said 'lol you're going yourself'. The others are mostly okay but they all follow her example and laugh when she says those things. We applied for a position and she got it today and I didn't and she got together with our other friends and one of them admitted to me in private she made fun of me for not getting it. That was the only thing I was looking forward for to come back to school next year. Now I'm honestly thinking what's the point as I obviously don't have real friends, no one, teacher or student, likes me enough to give me any position and even the person that's really mean to people and gossips behind everyone's back is more liked than me. I don't mean to be whiny or annoying, I just really needed to get this off my chest and I thought this would be the only place that can understand.",/r/depression/comments/69idr0/my_friend_makes_me_want_to_kill_myself/

8,1494030542,Unapaulagetic93,I'm an ugly piece of shit and it's cool,"Well, I can say that I'm not spiraling and am planning on doing some self care in a bit, just needed to get this off my chest. Looking back on my life, I feel like its a mistake. When I was a baby I had a life threatening illness that was required to be watched/treated everyday. I saw the docs every other day and they were really dismissive, rightfully so they were trying to save my life. According to my mom, from the time I was three I used to take the needles out of my arms and fight them like hell because I didn't know what the fuck was going on. My therapist thinks the dismissiveness fucked me up developmentally which makes sense because I don't trust anything. I don't trust my thoughts, what I say, how I speak, used to second guess so much in high school that people would clap when I finished tests, second guess my texts to the point that I'll come up with nine different versions of the same sentence and then end up not replying, am so indecisive and numb (numb as in don't feel a certain way about any choices)that I consider it a personal accomplishment if I don't get someone's opinion, second guess so much that I need a GPS to get to places I know how to go to like my house, and honestly I hate the expression ""be yourself"" because I don't really feel like there's anyone in there. I can't explain it. It's like I don't have a gut instinct and have shit confidence. People tend to think I'm very timid, weak, stupid, and awkward even though deep down I feel like I may be a lot stronger and smarter. 

Thinking about this part of myself that I don't even know how to change, that therapy hasn't helped at all, makes me feel like a fluke. I was supposed to die when I was young and part of mes surprised that i wasn't taken off the market like I'm pretty useless. I'm the human embodiment of a mistake. I feel it when I walk into class late and my social anxiety makes me forget how to walk right. Everything thats happened in my life has pointed to that. 

I had a botched nose job a couple years ago and it fucked with me a lot because I used to be pretty. I went in for a septoplasty near the end of high school (I'm a singer and couldn't breathe out of one side). Surgery was alright but afterward surgeon gave me a steroid and it fucked it all, I'm talking dissolved the tissue. My family couldn't afford corrective surgery so I went two years looking like that which was...really hard. Well when I got to college, my dad retired and got enough money for me to get it corrected. I got it redone and I'll admit its a lot better than it was, but I will never be beautiful. I know looks aren't everything but I know for a fact that no one will ever take an interest in me because of them. Nowadays people tell me I look ""intense,""  ""angry,"" or ""fascinating"" if someone wants to sleep with me, and ""German build"" sometimes? I do have people here and there who think its cool that I look the way I do, hell I don't mind it sometimes, but the angel of death/valkyrie comparisons get old.

Besides that, I have crippling major depression, suck at almost everything, memory problems, etc. I'm the wrong person to live out the dreams I have and it sucks to realize that, that your body and brain is only capable of so much. I just wish I could see who I would have been without all this extra shit. I'm mainly sad because I feel like I have a big heart and could really love someone but because of my looks and personality, its probably not gonna happen. I think my journey will be about accepting that. I don't feel as sad about it as I used to. Some people are meant to be alone and I think I'm one of them and that's okay. I think I need to start seeing this life and this body as a temporary thing. I'm a soul and that's what counts, I make music, I want to help others, etc. Maybe me being alone and okay with it will help someone else accept it too someday and not feel ashamed. That would be a dream. I'm gonna try seeing the spiritual side of things and kind of go on my own journey w it. Anyway, I think I'm done. I've never opened up about all of this so the weight's off a little. Thank you guys for the support lately.

9,1494030592,my_alt_re_depression,Interview process. I'm not diagnosed an I think I am on the edge between depression and non-depression.,"I'm not diagnosed and I think that at the moment I'm on the edge between depression and non-depression.

There was a time when I was more depressed, and I think that from that time I still carry [the inability to connect with people](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/62re2i/had_depression_now_i_still_cant_connect_with/). I haven't healed that.

I'm doing some interviews for a job. That job is the kind of job that I dreamt about doing, and I should have a lot of enthusiasm for this one. But I don't.

So I have two issues:

1. Lack of energy

2. Inability to connect

So tomorrow I will have an important interview in this hiring process, I should have prepared some material, but it's night now and I still have to do some work. I will be able to finish that, but my preparation and my interview won't be as good as it would have been.

Also, in the interviews I've done before I had to prepare myself, and I didn't prepare as well as I could.

Basically, I didn't do my work early and I did it late and in a bad way.

This was the kind of activity that I used to excel at. I thought, if I managed to get a job in this field, it would have been a piece of cake because I like it so much that it doesn't take effort and toll.

I'm not making excuses, it's laziness as well. I'm at fault, But the lack of enthusiasm, from a realistic perspective, plays a role--not that I want to discount my fault.

I guess that I won't be selected and I have to realize I'm actually no longer fit for that job.",/r/depression/comments/69ieh5/interview_process_im_not_diagnosed_an_i_think_i/

So I was going to propose to my girlfriend this year and I had it all planned out and it was going to be amazing. I put some serious thought into it and it was going to be perfect. I even got her daughter something so that she wouldn't feel left out and that she would feel part of it and know just how special and important she means to me also.

Well, we are no longer together and she wants nothing to do with me. Welp, the Jewelry store I bought the engagement ring from won't take it back. I got the ring a couple months ago because I saw it one day and it was perfect and I didn't want anyone else getting it. It wasn't cheap either. I know, I'm an idiot. But I had every intention on marrying this girl and thought I was spending my life with her so money didn't matter at all.

I know I won't get anything near for what I paid for the ring. Anyone have any suggestions? I don't really want to go to a pawn shop, plus I'm sure they will give me like 30% of what the ring is worth. I appreciate any reply's, thank you.

I become aware of the fact that I am just a brain inside a body, receiving signals from my eyes, sending signals to my arms and legs to make them move. It makes me question the nature of reality. Everything is just atoms and physics. It's a bad feeling.

The pain is still fresh and it was ultimately the result of her lack of understanding of my depression and stress. As well as a lack of understanding her own feelings. 

This is the first relationship I've been in this deep and it's left me feeling broken. Like, I won't work for anyone else and no one's ever going to love me as much as her. I can't stop thinking about her and I feel like I've been bothering and alienating my friends by continuing to have to vent about this 5 months later. I've lived a very quiet life (I'm 23.) and I'm pretty bad at social things, so I've been relatively alone since the break up. I was alone before meeting her as well. I have good friends and stuff, but she left a hole inside of me and I feel incomplete. Tons of mixed feelings, anxiety, and the seven stages of grief have all been a daily parts of my life for these past few months. There have been points where I considered suicide as an option to end my suffering and stress, but I can catch myself before I fall any deeper. A lot of people just tell me I need time or to find a fling and revel in my youth. All of that stuff just doesn't feel right at all...

After I've secluded myself for long enough I start to feel lonely and go out and have social interactions again. Then the cycle starts again.

56,1494041545,myusernameishuge,I hold in my depression and don't let anyone know about it.,"I'm a 31/M. I'm in the IT industry with my own business. I have few real friends and they all don't live anywhere near me. I work a lot to keep me from being reminded of how depressed I am. I also go lift at the gym regularly, hike, and occasionally rock climb to help me ignore the depression as well. 

My working a lot caused my girlfriend of 2.5 years to break up with me last year and I don't blame her. I'm very self aware and know that I'm socially awkward, but when I'm working that goes away. I try to use humor to also mask my depression, but at the moment I don't feel like it. I'm just having a very down moment.

I have a hard time meeting friends and even harder time meeting girls because I just assume they don't want to talk to me. I use Tinder and there's times I just swipe right on anyone and don't get any matches. This just adds to the depression and confirms I'm not one that people want to be seen with in a social environment.

I should mention that I do go to a therapist once a week to talk for over a year already, but I even have a hard time really opening up to him. I mostly go just to have someone to talk to each week about random topics that I have to look forward to.

My thoughts are really all over and there's a lot more I could say, but the fact is during the day when I'm working around my customers nobody would ever be able to tell how depressed I am or even at family functions or rare occasions that I'm invited out for something. Once I get home at the end of the day I'm very alone. I dread the weekends because I know I won't have anyone to be around unless I can book some appointments for work, but that's not too often for the weekend. I haven't tried to ever kill myself, but in my head I have a feeling that at some point in my life my death will be my decision.

I just kind of needed to let that out. If you happen to read this I really appreciate you taking the time for that.",/r/depression/comments/69j7dc/i_hold_in_my_depression_and_dont_let_anyone_know/

After one of the more brutal weeks in Layne’s early yet disappointing career he sits alone in his apartment with a glass of cheap whiskey and a cigarette quivering in his mouth, wondering how he got to this point. 

Not a moment goes by throughout his day where he wishes he could profoundly express how he feels.  Whether it is to his co-workers or just merely random people in general.  Every day it’s an act, every day he feels like a puppet to the cogs in the machine that are churning him into dust, slowly fading away into the realm of nothingness.  

Yes, Layne understands the realities of the real world.  He can fully fathom how tough, hard, unforgiving, and relentless it is.  And that we all have an obligation to force a smile Monday through Friday.  If not he faces extreme scrutiny or jeopardizes garnering the puzzlement of others. But still with this realization, he just wants nothing more than to honestly tell someone the truest emotional pain that has become internalized within him since his youth.  But he knows it’s a lost cause.  People undeniably appreciate being sad or frustrated throughout certain points in their life.  Whether it be the time they were dumped, or received a bad grade, or got that parking ticket out of nowhere. 

Yet, this is something far…far more profound than just the run of the mill disappointment that comes with gliding through life.  This is a deep sense of loathing and dejection that has manifested itself inside his brain for which he cannot find the reason or find the truth. At times Layne feels like a bitter ice-cold blanket has been thrown over him…suffocating him…so cold that he becomes to numb and emotionless to his surroundings. 

The Marlboro’s ash reaches his lips signaling it’s time to flick it away without a care in the world and takes a swig of Jack.  Yet through these disturbing yet routine moments on Fridays, he checks his phone…hoping…praying that a woman has shown some curiosity in him.  Nothing as per usual.  It’s been almost two years since he’s felt the physical touch of a woman yet that’s not what he yearns for.  No, not even close…all he wants is to look a woman in the eyes and feel the pain fade away. 

Wishful thinking indeed…

I hate every bit of this.

I tried killing myself a few weeks ago again. I was ready. I didn't even have the energy for a note. I had the pills. I had the hurt. But someone took them from me. Why did they forget to take the hurt as well?

I used to love writing poetry. Now I detest every word I write. I've been throwing up again. I've been shutting people out. They make my head ache. They make me feel worse. At the same time, I feel so isolated. So lonely. I'm dooming myself, aren't I? I told someone I was trying to get better this week and they laughed at me. I think they're right. I feel so inadequate. So useless. Nothing is going right for me; the people around me are too caught up in their problems - which is fine, it truly is, I just wish they would be there for me like I am for them. Nothing interests me anymore.

I haven't gone to my therapist in months. She told me I might have borderline personality disorder and I ran because in my country, they don't care about technical terms. They don't care about context. They don't empathize. To them, you're crazy. I'm crazy. Somebody left me a few weeks ago because he couldn't deal with me. He couldn't deal with my breakdowns and my distance. I don't blame him. I blame myself. Everyone pities me. I pity myself.

I'm a Sophmore in High School, and the final is for AP World History. I did a lot of studing a while back, but this week I've just been in denial and I procrastinated a lot. I've always been depressed, but this has been the most stressed I've been in a while, if not forever. This week I even had physical symptoms of my stress, stomach pain, tinnitus for a brief moment, lower back pain, neck pain, and an uncontrollable eye twitch that went on for two days. Mentally, it's been rough too.

I know that other people are able to face the same things and not be as stressed, and are also able to succeed better, but that's just not me. I think I'm much more sensitive to stress than most people.

Sorry for the wall of text. I could go on and on, this might as well be my life story. But I don't want this to be a ""feel sorry for me"" kind of post. I just need to tell people that I struggle with the things that most other people seem to get easily.

I ran across a profile of a woman I had a date with years ago. It was a bit awkward -- the date -- but she seemed nice. I don't know why but we drifted apart and didn't talk again after the date. So, I ran across her profile on a dating site and sent her a message. She was very condescending. I don't know what I was expecting, but what can I say -- I'm lonely.

I also found out my insurance Auto debited today and I'm now overdrawn by about 100 bucks, with only change for gas money until payday next week.

On top of that, I spent about ten years battling through numerous health issues in pursuit of a college degree. I graduated last year in May, and all I've been able to find for work is retail customer service. Every job I apply for, I never hear back from, even when I just ask for feedback or advice on my application.

Every job I find for entry level work requires 3-5 years of experience.

I just feel so close to giving up. I feel like my inevitable future is to be a homeless cripple. It just makes me want to die. I don't feel suicidal, but sometimes I just wish I could sleep forever. Every time life seems like it might improve a bit, my freshly renewed hopes are crushed once again. 

I live with family because I can't afford to live on my own. I live in a very expensive area. I want to move to Oregon, but I can never find any jobs there that fit my education and skills.

I guess the point if this is to vent. There are several other things that bother me and burden my mind every day, but today I just kind of broke down and started crying at my desk when I looked at job openings that pay only a dollar or two more than my retail job.

104,1494053055,zedd61,I'm in love with someone I'll never have.,"Recently, probably the last few months, I've hit an all time low. I'm stressed to the brink with a flood of bills and a dead end job that drains my soul every day. It's not physically demanding or anything...I just can't stand it there.

I've also been into writing for a while now. Only recently have I become a freelance writer for a few sports websites, which is a great thing to do. It's something I enjoy...or used to.

Over the past few months I've hit a point where nothing brings me any joy. I've been depressed for years but there have always been things to help deal with the shittier days. Not anymore. The music has gotten bland, the food is tasteless. Writing is now more of a necessity than a relaxing thing for me since it's my secondary source of income.

I've lost feeling for everything...except one person. We know each other through our best friends and began hanging out pretty soon after we met. When I stopped caring about everything else, when nothing could break me out of a funk, just being near her made my day ten times better.

A few weeks ago we kissed. Week after I asked her out. Problem is....one of the things I've lost is my...performance. As I stopped enjoying music and became less interested in my hobbies, I also lost the ability to be aroused.

We went to the beach Saturday night. A day trip she suggested. I was hoping it would get my mind off everything. We got to the shore and laid there talking for a while. She was gorgeous. I mean when I look into her eyes...I've never felt this kind of emotion before.

We go back to our hotel room, I can't do a damn thing. Just useless. The next day she broke it off because she said she couldn't feel the spark she thought we'd have. The thing I feel every time I'm near her. She doesn't feel it.

I've been beating myself up about it all week. We're back to hanging out like normal like none of that never happened, and I'll have to get over it eventually. Just kind of sucks to feel a connection like that and it go nowhere.

110,1494055601,VincentAirborne0,My Story,"Its been a slow build up to now, I've been dealing with depression for years now.  Realistically it will only get worse as I don't forsee a time coming where I can get help or fix it.  Theres no threat to my life, suicide will 99% never be an option for me.  Partly me being drained of all energy, but mostly me never forgiving myself if I went through with it.

I used to be confused by the phrase that depression is like drowning.  I was thinking about it wrong is all.  For me depression is close to something like drowning, but not in water.  I can breathe, theres no threat to my life no matter how deep I go.  But its hard to move and it keeps getting harder, very slowly but surely, everyday.  I feel pain, but mostly apathy.  I have to remind myself to enjoy things now.  I still feel emotion at least, but more sad and angry than happy.  Not like thats anything new when you have depression though.

I care for others deeply, and constantly think ""I don't want anything bad to ever happen to anyone else"".  When I see someone in emotional pain I wish I could take it from them and make it mine, so they didn't have to suffer.  But I'm smart enough to know that doesn't help anyone.  If you take a normal persons pain they'll become desensitized.

I feel empty.  Theres a hole I want to fill that I cant.  No amount of love, pleasure, joy or anything else could ever fill it.  I patch it as frequently as I can but it will always open back up.  It hurts.  Like a small ache or pang inside of your heart you can never get rid of.  Sometimes it feels hard to breathe, but thats just going back to the drowing feeling.

I like to believe that their is a soul, or heart, thats seperate from the body and mind.  No hippy stuff, just that everyone has a part of them that we're not quite able to grasp.  Scientifically and as a human race spiritually.  It could be attributed to ions or electrostatic radiowaves.  Maybe its an actual tangible part of us we just can't see.  But I still like to believe it.  Maybe its just because it can act as proof of a higher being.  Not God or Budha or whatever else, just that theres something or someone above us.  That theres something more important than us, or that not everything is controlled by cells.  

Maybe its to seperate myself, my persona/concsious/core from my mind.  A belief my mind came up with in an attempt to keep my true self uncontaminated by my mental illness.  So that maybe if there is an afterlife/rebirth/""return to the life stream"" whatever makes me, me, stays intact.  Maybe nothing like that exists.  Maybe I just got awful luck of the draw in the gene pool and got stuck with a disease that tells me every second of everyday that I'm worthless.  Maybe the idea I sometimes have of my depression being another me inside myself I endlessly battle for control isn't that far-fetched.

In the end, I don't really know what depression is to me.  When I first thought/knew I had it, I romanticized it.  I thought ""This is my quirk!  This is what makes me special!  This is what makes me different/better than everyone else"".  Then the pain didn't stop, and I thought it was a curse.  I wondered why I got picked to harbor so much sadness and so much pain and I *hated* whoever did this to me.  Then I became numb, to a point, and felt myself become desensitized to emotions in an effort to make it more bearable.  In an effort to live.  Now this has failed as well, and just made it harder for me to be happy and laugh.  Not impossible, far from it.  But its cripled me compared to a normal person.

And here I am now, writing this.  You can take it as a story of hope, that I'm still here and ""fighting the good fight"".  Never giving in no matter how hard I'm beat.  Perhaps its a sad story to you.  One of hardship unending, till the day I die.  Maybe its bittersweet.  Of course its horrible, but I still care and try to enjoy life as much I can.  It could be story that makes you mad, a story that tells you you're not alone or a story that says what you couldn't find the words for.  Hell, it could just be a bad story to you.  But this is, no matter what, my story.  This is the story thats my life.  These are the days I live and the thoughts I have.  And I don't think I could trade them for anything.  At the end of the day this story made me who I am.  

If you happened to read all of this, I applaud your dedication and thank you for allowing me to share a part of myself with you.  I hope any troubles you're facing now can soon be resolved, and if they can't I just want you to know theres someone out there who *cares* and feels pain at *your* pain.

113,1494056657,Pocketrhinozz,What do I do?,"Last July of 2016 I met a friend who I'll name ""Alice"" we met through an online game. The first day we met we talked for about maybe 7 hours straight. We talked about eveything. We just got along so well. Alice lived in Canada but was going to love an hour away from me. Which made me happy. But at the same time sucked because moving away from a place you grew up all your life into somewhere you don't know let alone know anyone must be terrible. Anyways she finally moves in august. A month later or so Alice finds out she has a tumor in her brain. She suffered from migraines a lot and doctors never found out why till then. So she goes back to Canada for surgery. The night before her surgery I stayed up all night waiting for her text saying she's going into operation. The last few texts we sent were "" what if you don't wake up or what if you forget about me"" she replied "" you're unforgettable it can't happen"".
A few hours later I wake up to a message her mom sent saying she's fine and just recovering. But from that day Alice was never the same. She got mad easily, annoyed, ate so much more her appetite seemed so much. Yet she remained in good shape, after getting the clear from her doctor she flew back to California. But things were different. She didn't laugh at my jokes that much anymore. A few months later her mom dies. That's when Alice pretty much gave up on eveything. Her real father died a while back now her mom. She didn't really like her step dad and her brothers just were young. I told her I'll be here for you. But from that day she thought running away from me was the answer. Being alone would solve everything. I would fight to keep her in my life and fight to be in her life. She means so much to me. Now currently she's told me she wants to change her number that way I'll never be able to talk to her. Idk what to do. Eveything I think about all I can think about is her all the good times. But there's no way to help. She's in a house somewhere alone idk her address. It may seem foolish to care about someone I met online.

114,1494057259,alexisjr,I have low self-esteem and struggle with depression. Would appreciate any advice,"I have always been someone with a low self-esteem and since a few years ago in high school, I've started being depressed. There was a profound moment during the start of my university life which put my self-esteem to an all time low.  
  
When I entered university residences as a freshman, there's this 1.5 week of ""orientation"" camp where all freshmen of that residence has to join. That camp ain't any normal camp, all freshmen there would get verbally abused and critiqued by the older senior students, which apparently has a greater purpose about strengthening one's character or something alone those lines. But anyway, I didn't really know anything about the existence of this camp until like a few days beforehand. So I went in sort of not really sure what's going on and first night I, just like other freshmen, was verbally abused by seniors. As mentioned, I didn't know much about this camp coming in, and I got really provoked and took in what they said personally. I got really upset and then decided to leave the day after (a few others also left); and the tutors said I will have to do this camp again next year since I quit.  

Note that this camp was before university started. So when university came, I went back to the residence to live. I was chilling with some other freshmen buddies one day, and this senior who was friends with those freshmen just randomly said to me ""I find those who quit (the orientation camp) really pussy"". As someone who is rather soft for a male, low self esteem, and have been suffering from depression, it hit me hard. I've quit that residence for a year now, but what he said to me still hurts me now and again. I've had a tough time handling what he said. I know I'm rather soft as a person which I really do like to improve on, but yeah...

128,1494061768,cookiescoffee,Am I unlucky or I should be alone forever?,"Well it started almost year ago. People always thought that I am a person who doesn't worry about relationships, so I also thought that it's true. In the middle of 2016 I had a crush on my best friend's best friend. We were flirting for ~3-4 months and I think I was in love. We met several times and after that we decided to be together. I thought that it's a really good relationship, we were like friends, I could tell him everything and vice versa. But after 3 weeks together I was on a party. My (now ex) boyfriend called me and told me how he loves me and some shit like that. 10 minutes later he texted me on Facebook that he never loved me and he's breaking up with me and he can't feel emotions because of his metnal illness (well it's a bullshit because he started a relationship with another girl 2 weeks later). It destroyed me. I couldn't feel any positive emotions untill I found somebody ""better"" (I thought that he's perfect). He was my crush for 3 months, but he was a really shy guy. Because of my ex boyfriend, I was overthinking so much and every day was another painful part of my life. But crush broke his shyness and started to flirt and everything. We were happy together, first 3 months of our relationship were beautiful. But after this time he started to control my every step, he was weird and made some bad things that were destroying me inside (but I don't want to write and even think about it). I was living like that for next 3 months because I was afraid of being alone, I tried to handle his psychopatic approach, but it was really hard for me. But then I met somebody. He was like a medicine, his self confidence was really impressive. I knew that he wasn't a fuckboy or something, and as my friend told me, this boy had a crush on me for some time before we met, he was asking a lot of questions about me. We met once (but just like friends, I still had a boyfriend) and I realized that I can't be with my boyfriend anymore. We broke up and that new boy was like my guardian, he was cheering me up all the time. Once, when we were on a party together we were hugging all the time and he made me feel loved again. But as he said, we were meeting and dating for too short time to be together (I thought the same), so we were just meeting (or dating? I don't know if he was looking at this like me) and flirting a lot. And he was acting like somebody who is intrested in me. We just loved spending time together. But I was overthinking all the time, I was kinda scared to be confident and I was thinking about a friendzone or something like that almost all the time. But we were still meeting, he was telling about me to his friends and everything was almost perfect. But the last time we met (about 2 weeks ago) he was.. idk, weird? We met also with my friend, we were watching stars. He also borrowed me his hoodie so I was like ""ohoho, noice, it's the cutest thing ever"". But after 10-20min I stated to feel useless when they were talking all the time about studies and things and I was just hearing. I think he noticed my disappointment and tried to talk down but not too much. He was treating me like totally different, like a random girl that he never had crush on. When I came back to home I was really depressed; I knew that something has happened. He texted me 2 days later and our conversation was so short and I think he was doing everything to end this (idk why he started this conversation). I texted him 2 hours later that I have his hoodie and he didn't give a fuck and replied with ""xD"" or some dumb shit (I wanted to ask if I should give it to him or anything but meh). Yesterday I met with my best friend who knows this crush very well and he told me to start a conversation with him. I agreed, because being quiet is the best way to end a friendship (I think we were in a friendship). I asked him if he want his hoodie because it's sad cause nobody is wearing it and he answered that ""he will ask for it soon"", I asked ""how long that ""soon"" will be"" and he answered ""idk"". Even my  friend was shocked because as he said my crush is never acting like that and I knew about that perfectly. I feel so bad because I'm torturing my friend with this situation and he doesn't want to hear about that and nobody can help me. I don't know what should I do and it makes me so sad because I'm so unlucky and I don't even know what's wrong with me. I'm afraid of my love situation and I can't think about anything else. I wanted to ask him about it but I'm scared of his answer or ignorance.. I'm starting to hate myself, I can't even make a good friendship with somebody new.. I know, it sounds like something like ""next boring teenager without any serious problems"" but it really makes me depressed, especially that I don't know what is wrong with me...

Fuck girls. My self esteem is so fucking low, and I can't imagine this helps in any way. I feel like the least interesting person in the world, as nobody seems to want to know me for very long. I'm at the point where I want to die. I've been depressed for so long, and it just doesn't seem like it ever fucking gets better.

135,1494063556,cromez0,Self care does not come naturally to us.,"I noticed that people without depression invest in a lot of time in taking care of themselves.  They spend money on their appearance, their health, their comforts, etc. without a second thought. Their whole life is basically built around that. Their whole attitude, the way they interact whit people, everything is based around how it can benefit themselves.

But with people like us is there a voice in our head that tells us that we don't deserve such care and don't deserve to go forth to find our own comforts? As if that is too selfish?
For me it's weird to even think about spending too much money on myself and I feel guilty when I do.

Even when I had bad acne growing up  I wouldn't think it was okay to go to a dermatologist.
When I had really bad digestive issues for a long time, it didn't occur to me that I should get it checked by a doctor. 
When I had holes in my shoes it didn't occur to me that maybe I should get new ones until someone started badgering me about it.
When I go into a clothing store, I purposely don't buy clothes that I like because I think I'm not good enough for it.
Growing up, I never went to a hair salon because I thought it was too fancy for someone like me.
When someone treated me poorly or if something was wrong with what they did, it didn't occur to me that I can report them or do something about it other than just taking it.

And I'm just like, ""why do I do this?"" Other people never do this. Other people do everything in order to take care of themselves and don't belittle themselves like that-and they believe they deserve the best and fight for it.

I'm also frugal, but just a realization to the fact of how self-deprecating people with depression are. Because when you look around, you realize that people who aren't depressed don't put their needs as second to everyone else's. And now I'm just left wondering here why and how and when I learned to be like this? When was I conditioned to believe that I am less?

Are you guys like this, too? Do you have a tendency to think you deserve less than others?

148,1494070488,sillytornado,I'll never be able to socialise,"Like many others I have almost no motivation. The only activities I do during my free time is to watch stuff on youtube or play games, but these days I instead choose to lay in bed rather than do those things. I do study moderately only because I had to change school due to not studying at all. 

However, to socialise is the worst. I have no friends besides my family, and it's been like that for ~6 years now. That wouldn't be so bad if things were changing, but they aren't. Soon I'm an adult. I've actually tried speaking to people in my current class. Smiling, asking them questions about what their interests are and so on. It doesn't end up well. I feel terrible, hate my voice, hate how I have nothing to say because I never do things and that's why I'm totally empty inside (besides having these thoughts and feelings). I'm not able to advance. I wouldn't want to befriend myself, so why should others want to? Also, I judge others harshly. Often I think I'll be better off not being with ""those people"". It isn't always like that, though. I remember a girl in a previous class I was in and thought she was a genuinely nice and beautiful girl, but how am I, a person without interests, friends or courage supposed to be her friend? I realise that I'm extremely hard on myself, and it's no wonder, seeing as I've gone through the better part of my teenage years wandering alone with nothing else to do than think about iife, or how I wish I was in bed.

Therapy didn't work and I've gone to three different school counselors as well. I've wasted years only walking home and watching others do more exciting things. As I'm too tired to try therapy again it's up to me to change things and, deep down inside, I know I'll never be able to make a difference in my life.

Is there some hormone or something connected with puberty and everything after that that I can destroy or remove from myself or something like that?

my heart he has treddled

and my mind wont stop to think

about this viscious theft

emotions, and such, its happened before

Life is a beauty,but not when you're alone

some people say its okay, but my days drone

No sleep, no food, no rest for me

I miss the days my life was filled with glee

Now I feel the pain

TO my life its a drain

and I want to be set free

You may be happy, you moved on in two days

my heart exploded in a fiery blaze

Now I love you more than I you see,

but at this rate I'll be hanging from a tree.

Makes me feel spoiled when I read some of the posts here. I sincerely hope you find someone you can talk to.

My family would not understand if I spoke to them. We come from different worlds and have very little common ground. 

Work is where I am at my best, presumably because I am constantly distracted with projects. My coworkers would never suspect me of being the one with depression. I am afraid that talking to a colleague about it would jeopardize our working relationship. I really count on those for my daily dose of ""belonging"".

Lastly, I have one friend I know would be discreet if I spoke with him. Our relationship revolves around sports and beer however, not sure how adding the depression dimension would affect it.

I suppose in all cases I am afraid to be perceived as someone with depression. Another fear is that my depression would not be taken seriously. But sometimes, usually when I am driving alone, I feel trapped and realize that maybe just talking to someone with help me get out.

Just wondering if anyone finds themselves in a similar spot.

169,1494078819,neobuxbaumia,Me [22 F] &amp; my two abusive relationships,"Sorry for my english, is not my native language.


My first relationship was abusive and mistreatment one. During that time I changed myself into some kind of monster, that relationship lasted for 2.5 years. At the start it was like a fairy tale, everything was fantastic, he looked like a fantastic person but in a few months everything started to go wrong. His family owns me 250€ money that I’m still looking for and him owns me like 500 which I hardly see any way to recover it. He tried to take my friends and family away from me, he made me smoke weed, gaslighted me, and raped me and sometimes he also assaulted me. He locked me into his room so I couldn’t get out cause lots of times I tried to go home. One time I needed to pee so badly and he didn’t let me that I even got an infection, and blood, and then he made me go walking to the doctor a one hour trip walking in the rain and my kidneys got infected.


My anxiety got worse and I started getting addicted to pills for it. Every time I got an attack he tried to hit me and everytime I tried to get away he said stuff like he was going to change, that if I leave him he would kill himself and one of this times he almost dislocated my should hurting me. One year his family kicked him away so my family taked him in. So I had him in my life 24/7, I coulnd’t go out, go with my friends and he was abusive every day. Everytime I went out for something he made me came back cause he was feeling bad or anxious. He told me his ex-girlfriend was so mean to him, but he was unfaithful to her lots of times. Lots of times he raped me without a condom, and in the second year that was the norm, now I can even have normal sex cause of this and I’m anxious everytime thinking like I could get pregnant or get and ETS. One time the condom broke so he cummed inside, I don’t even know. When I finally broke up with him he told me he would kill himself and over the phone I heard he was hurting himself. I never talked to him since then but he tries to stalk me on all social media all the time.


Now I was going to therapy but I quitted cause you know it’s hard and then I met a new guy from my class at the university. He knew I was weak and he used that situation so we could start a relationship and I almost didn’t notice. The kind of guy that tries every girl that broke up recently (he was even trying when I was at the end of the other relationship). It was the same a good tale at the start but then it was the same another time. I couldn’t go out with the people from our class cause it was his friends and not mine, I was the girlfriend there so I couldn’t go into the class group for ‘’reasons’’. He gaslighted me every day at one point everything was so strange to me that I started thinking I was crazy. He raped me like the other one, one time he told me he wasn’t in love with me anymore, he wanted to stop this and two minutes later he wanted to fuck me again even though I was crying and at the end he told me that he loved me very much. Sometimes he tried to rape me with friends over there. We broke up like 4 or 5 times but the next day we were back together like nothing happened. I couldn’t hold his hand in the street cause people could see us together and that was bad for his self-worth. 

That lasted 10 months, thanks to a friend I got out of it. Even when that ended he tried to make like we still were together, I had to block him from every social media but he is still in my class and I can’t change this even though I tried. He made the class against me and I had to stop my thesis and also stop my training period cause I can’t do it.


Now I’m stuck with depression, I tried to kill myself and I think I’m leaving a life that’s not mine. I’m scared, and I bear malice to everything. I can’t see anyone loving me or taking care of my life. I can’t look at myself at the mirror cause I feel ill. One time it was so bad that I weighted only 47 kg now I weight 57 and people told me I was better before cause now I’m fat. I want to stop going to university even though I don’t have much left. Every day I hate myself, I can’t seem to do anything, Four years of abusive relationships left me with anything inside.


I don’t even know what self-esteem is, I feel like I need to restart my life cause I don’t even know who I am. I’m scared of everything, I excuse myself to even breathe and I do stupid things cause I don’t even know how to act like a normal human being. I despise myself and even though I don’t want to do it I hurt everyone that tries to come to my life. I can even talk to anyone, how to do stuff, I suffer alone and in silence everyday.  Now I suffer from anxiety attacks and panic ones almost daily, I’m starting to hurt myself everytime I get one and sometimes I don’t even remember what happened. Sleeping is difficult cause I almost never get a good night, everyday I’m tired for everything and my back hurts from being tensed all day. I feel like I’m hurting my family and the people that tries to help me. Now I had to take my meds off cause I felt like I was getting to dependent on them to life and it’s hell.


I’m changing to a new psychologist and I will try to get on meds again, and that scares me a lot. What hurts me the most is that when I try to tell my problems everyone thinks that they aren’t that big of a deal, or that some things are normal, and then I feel like shit. Nowadays I can even get up, or go to class, not even thinking to do anything else in all day that being in bed and if sometime I feel better for something or I try to be better I need to stop and get myself in the shit again.

171,1494081437,sanora94,I really fucked up,"I've been in and out of manic and depressive episodes since about November and it finally all came crashing down around me a couple of weeks ago. I think i had a breakdown or something, not sure what else to call it. Almost made a really really big mistake that would have ruined a great friendship, then ended up being weird, irrational and awkward and ruined it anyway.

I coped horribly. I fell apart. The one thing i have that i'm proud of in my life is my sobriety, i'm in recovery after a stint doing way too many roxys for way too long. I've been in and out of this for about 4 years, but finally made a full year clean in January and thought i might be moving past it

Last Thursday night I fell, and it turned into a bender that took up my entire weekend. I threw away the one thing i'm proud of in my life as a way to cope and hide and when i finally leveled out and got away from it again I felt so fucking gross.

I guess I just needed to admit it and I don't have a place where I can admit it very easily. I had a friend that would listen to this rambling but I forced her to get rid of me by being an idiot. I guess the bright side is, i don't feel guilty over it and don't feel like it's something I have to hold against myself. Feels like this was necessary. Like I had to do it to get away from it once and for all. I don't wanna do this shit anymore and i had to remember why.

What I love about her is that she takes the time to spend time with me and really makes me feel appreciated. A lot of people think that just because you ha e a significant other that means everything is fine. Well, it isn't. 

I was laid off from my job this past Sunday, I have $500 in rent due by next Saturday. I'm back being super depressed. The thing that sucks is that I don't really feel like I have anyone else I can talk to by my gf about my problems and I don't want to lay everything on her. 

Today is such a beautiful day and I wish I had friends. The only friend I have is my gf. I don't want to take up all of her time plus she needs time to herself. It's so hard because I have all these people who claim they care but never really see them. I don't have a car which makes it hard but I wish they would take the time to make with me and us hang out. I never get any calls or texts from anyone really cept my gf. Only time people message me it seems is when people need something from me. 

I just wish I had a few friends that I could go to movies with, spend time with, friends that wanted to spend time with me, messaged me to make plans, wanted me as an active person in their life.

192,1494088199,daffyharry,Does depression ever truly leave you?,"Hey Reddit.

I've suffered from depression for as long as I can remember, have been on a different antidepressants at various stages of my life (citalopram, fluanxol and fluoextine) coupled with 300g daily of Lamictal, which has remained constant. 

Last year things took a turn for the better for me. I met my boyfriend, I bought an apartment and I got a new job. For the longest period of my life I experienced nothing but happiness, there were no signs of that dark, dark hole that plagued me for so long. This developed so well that I eventually stopped therapy, and my psychiatrist started talking to me about coming off my meds.

Earlier this year, he took me off fluoextine completely. A couple of months ago we talked about coming off the Lamictal in stages - I would go down to 200mg, then to 100mg after a month, and then stop completely after a month. I was fine up to the point when I went down to 200mg, at which stage suddenly my moods started swinging like crazy. I suddenly recognised symptoms I hadn't experienced before I started the Lamictal all those years ago, and it was terrifying. Luckily for me, my dad is a GP, so I told him everything and he immediately got me back on my standard dose of 300mg. He decided that we would start decreasing the Lamictal much more gradually, 25mg at a time rather than 100mg.

This happened maybe three weeks ago, and my moods returned to normal. However, lately, something else has changed. I am numb and I am constantly on the verge of tears. I question everything around me: whether my friends still like me, whether I'm any good at my job, whether I'm good at anything at all, whether my boyfriend still loves me, whether he's cheating on me, it's a constant spiral. There's this pit in my stomach that I haven't felt in a long, long time and I am constantly at the mercy of some very dark thoughts. My boyfriend can't understand what's going on and is always worried, but I don't know how to explain this to him. It doesn't help that he hates the idea of meds, although he's been very understanding. He is the loveliest, sweetest guy in the world and has been so supportive. I've never been so in love before. I was scared of the idea of him seeing me off meds, especially now that we live together, and I guess he's getting the experience now. 

I want to put this down to the fact that I'm having financial problems at the moment. However, a part of me thinks it's a little deeper than that. So this is my question, if you can call it that: do you ever just 'stop' being depressed? Does it come back without the slightest notice? 

Sorry if this turned into a bit of a ramble but my thoughts are all over the place and I'm in tears.

Yesterday it got increased to 30mg, which is apparently the antidepressant dosage range. I am desperate for it to have a positive effect on mood. I suffer from a multitude of symptoms resulting from complex trauma, one of those being severe depression. Has anybody had any success with this drug? In particular, has it improved suicidal ideation/thoughts?


How long should I give it to take effect? The reason I've been put on this is because I have been on every other type of antidepressant to no effect. This really is my last shot :(

So far I've noticed I'm sleeping a lot better which is great, but I am extremely groggy/foggy headed through the day. I suffer from a dissociative disorder so this isn't too great. I also have a huge appetite, like I LITERALLY cannot stop eating. I don't want to put too much weight on. Has anybody else felt this? Will it wear off?

195,1494088782,icarus_dawn,I'm normally just an introverted guy but this kinda tipped me over the edge. Now I feel like I've got a hole in my chest 24/7,"I know that this is probably nothing and that it's normal that things like this happen but it's a big deal for me.

(You can skip this and the next paragraph if you want to) This girl from my college that I liked asked me out for drinks but it never happened. She was nice, she was liking my posts over Facebook and we were hitting it off and flirting over text, talking for days at a time. Then she stopped replying to me, or just interacting with me in general. Normally this wouldn't bug a normal guy but I get anxiety when people don't text me back and I'm ridiculously introverted so I didn't want to seem annoying by texting again immediately. So I waited a few days before texting again, and when I did, no reply. I then find out, on the day that we were supposed to go out, that she got together with this dude on the day she stopped texting me back. 

Now this is probably a nothing event to most people but, again, I'm ridiculously introverted. I struggle to hold or even start a conversation with literally anybody, even my parents, so a girl I liked asking me out was a huge fuckin deal to me. 

This made me feel like I wasn't important, like I didn't matter. It dipped my self-worth a lot. I'm more or less just a sad person in general. I'm stuck in a course I don't feel passionate about or have any motivation towards, all my friends live far so I barely have any real human contact, I'm generally just a boring person who spends my free time at home getting drunk, playing video games and reading books, alone. I used to have bouts of loneliness that lasted for a few hours, at most a day, and they always passed and I ended up okay but this tipped me over into depression. Now I just constantly feel like I have this fucking hole in my chest where my heart used to be and that the world is crumbling down everywhere around me. And for the first time in my life, I've been having suicidal thoughts. 

It's not to the extent where I could actually kill myself, I'm too much of a pussy to actually do it and the closest I've ever gotten to killing myself was chain smoking two packs of cigs from 7pm until 4am. It's more of just thinking about not feeling like this anymore or just straight up not feeling anything anymore. Or just wondering what my funeral would be like.

Anyway, tl;dr this girl got together with a guy two days before our date and the whole event's pushed me over into depression. 

I don't know what to do anymore.

199,1494089620,OoXx123throw123xXoO,I [M23] lost her [F20] because of her depression. I feel like I’m going down with her.,"First of all I want to apologize for the grammar mistakes I’m about to make. English is not my first language. I’ll try to minimise my mistakes. And it’s a throwaway account because some people might recognise me.

I met her (let’s call her Z.) around this time of the year in 2016. It was nothing special at first. The usual stuff that happens if you start to date someone. She told me relatively early that she’s suffering from depression and that every relationship ended in her getting cheated on. That’s why it’s extremely hard for her to trust someone or communicate. She thinks she isn’t capable to maintain a healthy relationship. To make things worse, she isn’t going to therapy because apparently doctors only want your money and don’t care about you. „They won’t help me“. Major red flag I know. But let me tell you a little bit about myself. I’m not an depression-expert, but I had to fight with my own depressive episode back when I was 14. It went so far that my mother broke down crying infront of me because she thought that she lost her child. That was the moment I decided to change my life. I started working out, eating healthier and tried to be more open about my problems. I managed to pull myself out it. I can imagine how she feels. I know how it feels to be left alone. When everyone and everything is hurting you. I know how it feels. I never directly told her this but I wanted to be there for her. I knew that I couldn’t make her depression disappear. Especially not without her going to therapy. But I wanted to show her that not everything is evil. 



What started as a friendship quickly developed into more. When the time came I asked her if she wanted to become exclusive and she said yes. But gave our relationship only 5 months. She thought I won’t stay longer than 5 months with her because she’s too complicated and not ready for a real relationship. Red flag number two. The honeymoonphase was beautiful and I could really imagine spending the rest of my life with her.



I fucking love her family. That’s something I have to mention. Her parents are cool as fuck and her dog loves me more than anything. He would always jump and cry when I was visiting Z. and her family. They are living in a house outside of the city. It takes like 40min for me to get there with public transportation. Nothing too special. Her mother always told me that she thinks I’m good for her daughter. That she’s happy right know because I’m there for Z. I was there for her when she had problems with her schoolwork. I was there for her when she felt lonely and depressive. I was there for here when she was sick. Bought her food, rolled her into blankets to watch netflix together and cuddle. I skipped university classes to spend time with her. I’m a physics student so I spend a lot of time doing lab protocols or solving math homework. I’m not a bad student but I’m not an A student either so it never really affected me that much. I dedicated my whole freetime after university and the gym to her and it was sometimes not enough. She would tell me how I would choose the gym over her. That I’m only going to the gym to impress other girls. That I’m too muscular. Which I'm definetely not. I told her that I need this. Because it was one of the major things that helped me dealing with my own depression but I think she never believed me. Additionally she is an extremly jealous person. Not the „I fucking stalk you“- type of jealousy but the one that really hurts our relationship. She would just go into „no communication mode“ and would sit there silently. I tried everything to ease her mind but nothing worked. Her mother told me that’s something she has to deal with almost every week. And that’s probably one of her worst traits. It made my life so hard. I would get jealous myself because she was writing with other people while I wanted to talk about things. I was never really jealous in any of my relationships but if you get the silent treatment while she is constantly writing with other men…I don’t know. But help me god if I was talking to other girls. But I trusted her. She never did anything that really concerned me. She started tagging the same guy over and over again in facebook memes. That’s the thing that got me the most probably because that was something she always did with me. But those are memes. Nothing that would break my trust in her. But then the honeymoonphase ended. Man I was not prepared…



So we hit our „5 month goal“ and everything was fine. Of course the things I already mentioned bothered me. And I tried to talk to her but it was always the same. I would go down the stairs when she was silently lying in her bed looking at her phone and talk to her parents. Most of the time it was her mother. She would tell me stories about Z.‘s life before depression hit her and how I have to decide wether I want to stay with Z and hope for the best or leave her. But she can tell me that Z really loves me and cares about me. But the way she is showing this is different and she can understand when I want to breakup with Z. And then she said something that really haunts me until this day: „Every men in her life left her at some point (she’s not living with her biological father). Everytime things get worse they left her or cheated on her. And she thinks that you will leave her too if she says something wrong.“ So I decided to stay with her. Be there for her and love her like a madman. Tried to cuddle with her after a discussion or bring her sushi when she's sad and hug her for minutes. When she ignored me while I was talking about a problem I would just stop and hug her and tell her that I'm trying to do my best for her and that I love her.



But nothing I did changed anything. I think it made things even worse. Z started to talk to me less and less. Her messages started to get more distant. Only „yes“,  „ok“, „maybe“ and „I don’t care“. Sometimes it would be „doesn’t matter“ and this was by far the worst. She would always write this, when I was asking her about her day or her plans for the next day. She would just say that she has no time this weekend to see me. And I would just answer like: „ Ahh Okok. What are you up to? Just tell me when you have some time. We can go to a nice restaurant.“ I always tried to get her out of her bed. But sometimes I would just lay down with her cuddle with her while watching netflix. I never tried to force her to do something. Her answer would be „doesn’t matter. Wouldn’t change anything“. Now imagine your girlfriend giving you this answer every fucking time you ask her about her plans. I told her that I have a tight schedule too and have to plan around hers if she wants me to spend time with her. „It doesn’t matter if I’m going out with my friends or go to the cinema with my parents. I have no time.“ Now logically she has an argument. But that’s not how relationships work. I don’t want to know everything about her day and what she’s doing. Is it too much to ask her what she’s doing?



Now to the real problem I’m facing right now. I’m sorry for the long post but it feels so good to write everything out. I could write 10 more pages but I  just want to give you the most important information. I tried to deal with this for 4 more months until I couldn’t deal with it anymore. I told her that things aren’t really going in the right direction. I think our relationship won’t hold if things progress like they did before. Of course she sat there. Silently. She would lay down in her bed, facing aways from me, and just listen. I dont even know if she even listened. I told her how I felt. Told her that I don’t feel loved. No „I love you“ from here since 2 months, no compliments or even a „thank you“ for the food I cook for her or buy her. I felt used. I was honest. Maybe a little bit too honest. But I was devastated. I tried for too long to swallow everything down. I told her that she has to try talking to me. We have to talk about problems. I know that she keeps everything for herself but I can’t change anything if she remains silent. I know I’m not perfect. No one is but I really wanted this relationship to work because I fucking loved this girl with all my heart. And then the she went towards her wardrobe. Opened it and gave me every sweatshirt, tshirt and pants she „borrowed“ from me. 



You can’t imagine how fucking savage this was. I spotted the jacket I gave her on our 4th date or so. She later told me that she would cuddle with this jacket when I wasn’t around. My heart broke into 1000 pieces. I gathered my things and went downstairs. Her parents instantly knew what happend and her father was furious. Called her egoistic and that he’s done with her depression. She should get help. He’s very popular in his niche and owns a fairly big company where Z. and I are working. I’m working there since December as a working student and she is doing an internship since April. I don’t plan on leaving this company. Not because of a relationship that has ended. Her manager would complain about her because she was just on her mobile phone texting. That made her father extra furious because we both tried everything so the company gives her enough money so she can have her tattoo she wanted. She signed a contract for a 35hr week and 450€ per month. You don’t need to be Einstein to do the math. Her father as the CEO talked to the HR Department and couldn’t do anything. I spend one complete night to find a loophole in the contract. I had a good connection to the Head of HR so I could get her one with a possible payment of over 1000€.  And now we sit there. She just threw a relationship away. I’m devastated and her father is angry.



I tried talking to her after some days. I just wanted to have an explanation. I refused to go down without any form of explanation. She told me that she’s not ready to have a relationship. It’s too onesided and it’s only fair if she lets me go. She always told me that this relationship won’t work an that she can’t have a healthy one because of her depression. That’s not going to change and she doesn’t want me to suffer for it. I’m having a hard time right now. This move just crushed every little piece in me. She once told me that she can’t make decisions. And the only real decision she made was to get rid of me. FML



I can’t be angry about her. She made a descision and I have to accept it. But it destroyed me. It destroyed me really hard. I can’t sleep, can’t eat, I lost my breakupgains instantly after I got them because I’m so fucking exhausted. „I want to have a relationship but can’t do it. I have to find myself first and can’t have you wait for me.“ The last words I recieved. And the words of her mother still haunt me. I feel so useless right now. Everything I felt when I had my depression is coming back. I met her mother with the dog I haven’t seen in weeks in the office the other day. He instantly jumped me and was happy like he used to be. I nearly cried thinking about never seeing this dog again. I lost all of my self esteem. One side of me thinks that this isn’t over now and that the depression in her is talking. I can still see her in groups on whatsapp and line. She is just writing like always. Her flirty way of talking to those people is now so painfull to watch. I had to mute every group. Today she was writing to someone she really likes to flirt with: „I really love you for your bad sense of humor &lt;3 I hope you know this.“ And they were playfully talking about marriage. This sentence could have saved our relationship. Just a simple „love you“ and a hug. But it didn’t happen because of her depression. But it's no problem for her to say it to people she never met in a groupchat. You can not imagine the darkness I’m about to enter. And everything because I tried to love her with all my heart.

Met depressive Girlfriend who I dearly cared for just to get dumped after I talked about my feelings in the relationship. „I want to have a relationship but can’t do it. I have to find myself first and can’t have you wait for me.“ The last words I recieved. I’m devastated and her father‘s furious. Almost cried after I met her mother with her dog in the office. Now I’m just a mess. Constantly watching breakup motivation youtube videos and eating ice cream. 
I think I'll start watching Adam Sandler movies.
Help me.

200,1494089820,iamukiki,Foster kittens who passed this week...Found out I could have done more amd feel nothing.,"I was fostering 5 kittens and 2 passed this week...After talking to the vet, I may have been able to proactively bring them in because of their diahrea. I found one dead. The other I thought was dead, so I dumped it in a bag. She started moaning so I rushed it to the animal ER where she died in my arms.

I cried briefly, but then I had no more attachment.  I felt nothing. It must be the meds (cymbalta and seroquel), but I find it more upsetting than the kittens dying. I guess it's worse than agony and guilt. It reminds me I don't feel much anymore. When I am not medicated, I'm an unstable emotional disaster.",/r/depression/comments/69m7mg/foster_kittens_who_passed_this_weekfound_out_i/

202,1494090725,throwaway578578,"I have no confidence, I have no self esteem, but I have a relationship.","It is so unbelievably hard to be in a relationship when you hate yourself. I was in one for 2 years, 3 years ago but it went nowhere. She never would say the we were ""dating"" for the whole time. Only held her hand once, asked her out multiple times but it was always ""we should talk about it but not now"". I did other things things that I thought were cute and maybe she'd smile at (like telling her that my blanket smelled like her after she used it and that I liked it and it was comforting) but she just laughed and said that sounded creepy.

So cut to the present. Just got into a relationship with a girl I've liked for a while but have known for a couple years. Because we've been good friends, I assume it's a little strange to go from friends to bring in a relationship. But it's been about a month and I've held her hand a few times and had my arm around her a couple times. Sounds normal right? 

Well everytime I do that I can't help but think she hates it. A couple nights ago I asked her if she like me putting my arm around her and she said ""it was alright, I would have said something if I didn't."" So let on asked her if I could again and she said ""you can if you want"" so I did but she didn't really move or lean into it so I just felt bad. At the end of the night I asked if I could kiss her and she said ""maybe later"" which I can understand if she feels like things are going a bit fast.

But the long story short here is that, because of my first relationship (and other things like OCD and anxiety) I have no confidence or self-esteem. This makes me feel like everything I do or say to my girlfriend is for me and she hates it. Like in some way I'm making her be with me. It's her first relationship so she's nervous and isn't really good at expressing emotion so that's hard as well. She says she doesn't mind any of it but her actions don't say that and it makes me sick that I might be creeping her out. 

I just want to not feel like shit, I want to have some shred of confidence. I want to not hate myself when I think of it or look in the mirror. This whole ordeal has spun me into a week or two of constant depression. I'm usually high functioning, but I've felt so bad lately that I don't want to do anything and I lie in bed at night and cry until I fall asleep.

Thanks anyone for listening.",/r/depression/comments/69maky/i_have_no_confidence_i_have_no_self_esteem_but_i/
203,1494091428,flergityberg,"I started typing this. I'm not seeing a therapist right now, but this is what I would tell them.","I lived and worked in Asia for three years as an expat English teacher. I led a insane life there, lots of drunkenness, debauchery, spending weeks traveling alone involuntarily, doing way too much ecstasy, a different girlfriend every three months, and a lot of subsequent drama in my personal life. 

I came back in September 2015 to recuperate after it all became too much. I’m very grateful it’s all over and my life is relatively boring now (and I start graduate school for education in a few weeks, yay success). I’ve been doing a lot better for myself since I came back, but the last six months, my mental and emotional problems have been slowly increasing.

My father and I have never had a great relationship. We haven’t spoken much in the last few months, since we had a huge argument. This triggered an enormous amount of anger towards him that I now struggle with daily. I tolerate talking to him if he calls me, but I keep it brief because I feel at the moment that this is what I need. At the same time, sometimes I feel extremely guilty.

I had a lot of success with women in China, but these days I live in rural New England and that doesn't happen. I ended my last relationship voluntarily six months ago (me and the girl are still friends, hurray maturity) but I haven’t met anyone else since then, and it bothers me.  When I was younger, I was convinced there was something horribly wrong with me, but I realized later that it had a lot to do with this area; most people around here are middle aged, and I don't have much in common with the ones who aren't. 

It’s hard for me to meet women in my situation, with little life or friends outside work, and, while my social skills and looks aren’t terrible, I don’t have the same confidence I used to have, now being in my 30s and broke.

I know that it’s not like success with women=happiness, and that I should work on myself first. I’m not in any hurry to get married. But it’d be nice to get a freaking date now and then.

Mental illness runs in my family. I have a sister who suffers from depression and anxiety. While I was gone, she’d regressed to doing nothing, living in our parents’ basement, and being perpetually unemployed. My parents had gave up on her completely years ago.

I’ve been trying to help her get her life back together since I came back, and I have had some success; she now has a job and feels more confident than she once did. But helping her is a very stressful process for me and saps my energy, and I sometimes feel like I’m burning myself out. But I don't feel like I can stop trying to help her, either. I don't want her to end her days as a charity case.

I’m a substitute teacher (the one thing my experiences in China couldn't take away from me was that I loved teaching). I like my job, but it's stressful as shit sometimes, and when I have a bad day, it’s hard not to take my work home with me. Lately I’ve been taking a lot of days off because I’m feeling burnt out. 

I’ve always masturbated a lot, but I feel like I do it far too much. I’ve been addicted to porn for years. I’m trying to cut down on it and give up porn entirely, but it’s not working and it makes me feel like I’m  not in control of my own actions. I feel like it makes my overall mood worse. 

I also have something like PTSD. Multiple times a day, I will get involuntary twitches and tics in my body. This usually happens when painful, awkward memories emerge. They seem like they’re my body trying to distract my mind from twinges of mental pain. Sometimes it’s a simple head-twitch, sometimes my whole body shudders, or my hand flies off in one direction. It's not physically painful, but it's very embarrassing.

I start ruminating a lot when I’m alone, meditating on how much I hate someone or how frustrating something is for me. Or alternately, I ruminate on people that I miss in China, and whom I’ll never see again (especially women). I can’t get over two of my exes--never meeting anyone new doesn’t help.

My back hurts constantly, which keeps me from doing physical activities that I want to do.

I generally eat well and take good care of myself, but lately I’ve been stress-eating a lot of junk food, which makes me feel stupid and sloppy.

I find it very hard to get going on anything I actually want to do, like reading or painting. I spend a lot of time staring into space or dicking around with my phone.

About a month ago I took some LSD and I had obsessive violent thoughts for weeks. They have since subsided, but still bother me sometimes. I think it also made my tic worse.

I should be excited that I'm starting graduate school, but I'm starting it at almost exactly the same time I've realized that I don't like living around here. But I can't back out of it now without setting the clock back a year and losing thousands of dollars, so I'm doing it anyway. Yay?

I really want to see a therapist, and will have health coverage to see one when I’m a full time student at the end of the month. In the meantime, I’m involved in a mental health support group that has helped me out a lot. 

But still, I’m pretty tired of being miserable, impulsive, twitchy, in debt, in pain, and lonely, and I'd like for it to end, please.",/r/depression/comments/69mcxk/i_started_typing_this_im_not_seeing_a_therapist/

I'm a 12 years old Chinese and I go to middle school in seventh grade and I just can't endure how many anime fans make me feel uncomfortable in my school. Anime is just such a stupid trend I can not understand the mind of all these anime fans. I try to argue anime is for kids to anime fans to persuade them to stop watching but they just say some cringey things on how anime is violent or dark to counter me which makes no sense at all. My parents always said Japanese people are monsters and killed all of our ancestors and I should never gain affection to Japanese culture, and they were completely right. Anime is something even kids shouldn't watch, it is so immature, cringey, and it will make people fail in education. I've never seen an anime fan with good grades at my school because all they do is wear anime shirts and speak Japanese while talking. Hell, every time I see anyone with an anime profile picture on the internet I feel a surge of uneasy through my body. So many teenagers in China are also huge anime fans with collections of costumes and displays of anime gadgets and uses anime gifs and anime profile pictures and declare anime characters as their soul mate or something, I consider them all as traitors of my country. I honestly don't understand why people think anime is somehow not for kids. Honestly I think even kids shouldn't watch something this stupid. Does anyone know how to treat my depression? I seriously need help I feel like anime is unavoidable in my life.",/r/depression/comments/69mele/i_need_help_depressed_because_of_anime/

As to the one I saw: She was absolutely pleasant. She cared, and listened and let my mind wander mostly.

But I got to talk to someone and got to tell them the things I can tell noone and explain why I can tell noone. I got to confess to the things I know, and the things I expect.

I was afraid but I was desperate. Things were getting bleak. I tend to think of the decision to commit suicide as ""11:55 or 12:02"". For me, it's either too ""early"" to concern my friends. I can handle this. Or it's going to be too late.

It sneaks up on me
Sitting alone somewhere
and hugs me like a lead jacket
Finally acknowledging
A weight I've been feeling for weeks

Other times
It starts as a slow simmer
In the back of my mind
Until something turns up the heat
And everything boils over

Today
It hit like a punch in the gut
Forcing me to lie down
Trying to find the strength to do
The simplest task 
Like getting out of bed 

When it comes
A two-person dialogue starts
One, kind and gentle
Murmuring encouragement 
Only to be drowned out
By the ceaseless, hateful critic 

Sometimes
It is paralyzing and terrifying
Like suffocating or drowning
In my own thoughts and emotions

Other times
It creates a void
Where all happy, positive thoughts
Flow out into the ether
Leaving me in darkness 
Without emotion

Today
It is just sadness and a physical ache
From a mental wound
With no start or end
Or rhyme or reason

When it comes
I beg it not to go
Because without it
I'm not sure who I am

219,1494094912,JoshThomas892,Just getting stuff off my chest (21M),"Here's the background to my situation - at the age of 18, after securing good grades at A-Level, I went off to uni in September 2014, and just couldn't hack it. My subject (aeronautical engineering) was just too difficult, I couldn't fit in socially (I don't do clubs and stuff like that at all), and I struggled living away from home for the first time.

After three months, I quit, and spent about 4 months unemployed and on UK Jobseekers Allowance. Anyone who's ever been in that position knows how good JSA is at making you feel like shit - you're expected to turn up to an interview every week with evidence of your job search that week, and no matter what you bring, the interviewer manages to make you feel like a total scumbag for not having a job. On top of this, my dad is a very old-fashioned military man, who's been in the same job since he was 17, and through this entire time he barely spoke to me because he seemed to be so disappointed in me, which obviously made me feel even worse. The only person who dislikes me more than it seems he does, is *me*.

In April 2015, I got myself a job at a local secondary school as a ""maths intervention mentor"". To start with, this job did wonders for me, both socially and professionally - I became more confident, I found something I could do. However, over time, my boss (head of maths at the school) would assign me things that I struggled with.

As I tried, and failed to meet her expectations (which often came well beyond my own and others' expectations of the job), she would have increasingly frequent outbursts. The first took the form of her screaming at me, to which my response was simply to leave the room. 

Initially, it didn't affect me so badly, but over about a year or 18 months, these outbursts happened increasingly commonly. A couple of times, I waited a few hours then apologised for having annoyed her, but after I had no apologies for her overreactions on either occasion, I stopped.

I also ended up being expected to actually take lessons myself, on my own, as a teacher. When these inevitably fell flat, thanks to my complete lack of training, I began to feel as though I was failing the school by working there.

More recently, it became clear that these outbursts weren't just aimed at me; the entire maths department bore the brunt of them, and complained to the headteacher about them.

My light at the end of the tunnel eventually showed, in the form of a standard TA (teaching assistant) leaving her job around February 2017. I took that TA post, with the catch that I had to continue certain, smaller duties of the maths mentor while the school worked on finding my replacement.

Around that same time, I had a minor mental breakdown after a particularly bad lesson with year 11 (16 y/o's). I was sent home that day, and my local doctor diagnosed me with quite severe depression and anxiety. At this point, I understood what had felt like a dark cloud over my mind from Sept 2014 onwards. Since my diagnosis, I've slowly begun to understand more about my situation and appreciate it, respect it, etc.

My anxiety, 99% of the time, manifests itself in the form of paranoia. As an example, if I go out for a meal with a few friends and I hear a group laughing at another table, my mind automatically assumes that they're laughing *at me*. Then, my conscious, rational mind speaks up with a ""no they're not, you're being stupid"", then my anxiety takes back over and all I've accomplished is making myself feel stupid and self-conscious.

As for the depression, it has it ups and downs, as it does with everyone. I have no real friends outside of old school friends who come back from uni every 3-4 months or so. When I'm not at work, I spend my life in my bedroom, playing video games and watching TV shows as a way to escape from my own miserable life. Of course, work is a mixed bag; I'm having more variety in my timetable now, and feeling more useful in myself as a TA. On the other hand, some teachers fail to tell you what would help them out, which results in you just standing around accomplishing nothing for an hour. And of course, as anyone over the age of 18 can tell you, certain kids at secondary schools are just horrible people, that get kicks out of fucking with you.

I have zero appetite at any time, I spend very little time with family or close friends, and when I do spend time with family, I just end up arguing with them. My dad, in particular, is the ""get over it and get on with it"" kind of person. If he can't see it, it's not there. I'm sure he feels like he's helping, but in reality all I ever get out of talking to him nowadays is feeling like shit and feeling like I've let him down.

I have one friend I regularly talk to on FB, Jess. Just by talking to Jess, my mood seems to take a leap upward, and she cheers me up in a way no-one else I've ever met can. Music, in particular Paramore, has probably saved me from myself. Even as I write this post, I have Only Exception, Last Hope and In The Mourning playing to try and keep myself calm. I have my first tattoo booked for next Saturday, the old Paramore bars, as a way of reminding myself, as the lyrics of Last Hope say, that whatever happens, there's still a tiny little ray of hope that can keep you going. I managed to book tickets just last week to see Paramore at the Albert Hall in June, with Jess. I've also organised to go to RTX London and Comic-Con in October with a few friends, and all in all I'm back to feeling like I have something to look forward to.

However, I still have *those* days. The days where that little ray of hope feels that bit darker, and the light at the end feels that much further away.

My entire day today has been absolutely miserable for no reason other than ""my depression decided so today"". I told my parents I wasn't after anything to eat for dinner, or anything to do, and just wanted to stay in my room. And in response from my dad, I got ""fine, stroppy shit"", which made me feel about as good as you'd expect. I spent about a half hour crying, making me feel like a pathetic lump, before I decided to try and write this out, try and get it off my chest. 

I'm not expecting anyone to have read this far, or anyone to give me any miracle advice, and apologies for making it this long if you have read this far; it's just a bit of catharsis that I kind of needed today.",/r/depression/comments/69mom3/just_getting_stuff_off_my_chest_21m/

Why should I even deserve to get something good for me. I think I'll start eating again when I'm once again happy. If that day ever comes. Let the slow death begin.
Last night was when my humanity finally collapsed. I guess I just wanted to be punished. Not necessarily by anyone or anything, just self-loathing hatred. Humans really are messed up creatures. It's like we enjoy suffering. The second we fuck up unintentionally, we dwell in our own self-pity like souls in the lake of the underworld. I just wanted to not feel a thing anymore. So I decided to cut myself. I know what you're thinking, ""wow, what a baby."" Well, I wish a few cuts and scrapes was all I managed to do. Those heal.. What I did will be a constant reminder that I'm just a mistake. I started on the upper thigh, thinking I was just going to slice open my skin and no one would ever notice. It began as just a series of tiny cuts. But then I saw a wound on my left calf I had made previously after a devastating break up. I took my knife and dug into it and sliced back and forth to make an even deeper wound. However, the stinging pain I was expecting afterwards never came. It was completely numb. So I cut deeper and deeper. Still nothing. Then I ripped the remaining skin apart like an insatiable beast and reopened the wound deeper than before. It didn't hurt. I did feel weak from the blood lost. I don't know why I decided to self mutilate myself than blacking out with a bottle of Jack, but humans really are the destructive race. Only God knows why they do what they do. ",/r/depression/comments/69n17g/losing_my_humanity/

241,1494100930,Seppuku-,I'm sociable. But my depression grows as I'm isolated by others.,"Pretty long and noone will care so I'll put this here.

TL;DR - shattered self worth, esteem and social confidence after feeling abandoned by my ""best friends"" no meaningful relationships, I feel like a social reject but have a sociable nature. I don't know what to do, any advise/anyone in a similar place?


After exploring this sub for some time, on a rather regular basis, I've realised that many of you are saying that you isolate yourselves and many people give advice against this. My situation is a bit different to those others I have read about. 

I would consider my self sociable, I enjoy spending time with people, parties going out and just chilling with my ""friends."" However recently I have been unable to do this, my friend circle collapsed when a third of its members moved away and the remaining people spilt into different groups, leaving me alone.

It was alright at first, I still was close with my two best friends, however they are both in relationships and as a result have little time for me, as the majority of their free time is dedicated to their significant others or their new found groups. This has left me feeling  abandoned and alone. 

When seeing them on a Sunday morning they used to ask me how my weekend was, and I'd tell them shit, week after week for a course over 3 months. I would know exactly what they'd been doing, courtesy of social media. This didn't change anything though, not once did it result in me being invited along to something, despite me being friends with members of their respected friendship circles, and them knowing just as much. 

My self worth, esteem and social​ confidence are in shatters, not least due to my pathetic love life and the pain suffered from my recent and short lived attempts at relationships. ",/r/depression/comments/69n7t4/im_sociable_but_my_depression_grows_as_im/

But recently, things have been getting worse. I feel disconnected, like just another person floating around with no real goal.

Everything I loved, everything that helped me cope before just irritate me now. I want to talk to someone about it, but I just can't, I don't want to bother anyone.

School is the only place I can partly forget about how I feel, but that feeling never leaves, not even for a while. It's heavy yet it feels very empty at the same time. I can't even control myself in class. I broke down just because my teachers kept yelling at me for slacking off.

I tried emailing these people who talk to people that want help, and they replied, they're really nice people, but I just can't type how I feel, how am I supposed to express this?

I had dull blades I hurt myself with but today my subconscious acted on it's own and I stole a box of razor blades, why am I so stupid?

I come home, take a long nap and cry myself to sleep again, now with no real reason.

All the people at school have been really nice to me, some even want to be my friends, out of everyone, me. I am very grateful, but that doesn't make me feel any better. Why am I so selfish.

My mother never cared about I felt and it's even worse when she found a new boyfriend, but even if she left him, even if I lived away from her, I don't see myself feeling any better.

I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time. I'm so tired after pushing through so much, I feel like I can't anymore. I don't want to feel this way. I want to be energetic, I want to really enjoy everyday and everything. I want to be happy for once and not constantly exhausted.

I loved them, no actually it was just lust, but the feeling was never returned in anyway.  Wasn't really thinking about that, I remember what I was going to ask had everything typed in and everything.

I don't even know why the hell I remember this persons number probably because they destroyed me so much that it totally f'ed me up for good pretty much.  Totally acted out of malice on me for no reason and never made an apology not even afterwards, I mean was part of ruining my life so hard it changed it permanently and still is in contact with my family, who I don't talk to.  Cheated on me with my step-brother when I was in the house... Twice.  

Anyways point being I don't know why the hell I even thought about it.  Wasn't depressed, wasn't thinking about anything in particular and hadn't even thought about them in years.  Now today I'm depressed as hell and can't stop thinking about it (the almost text) I guess I was just wondering if they are as miserable and messed up as me afterwards or not, probably not.  Most people do horrible things out of malice in their younger years and move on, I've never even done something out of malice and still feel terrible like I feel another person's pain.

It just made me wonder if karma is a thing or if just acting however you want is how to live.  I mean sociopaths do it and they are always fine and manipulative and no one even realizes it they just indulge them because they know how to put on different masks.

It's my birthday, I'm turning 26, and this marks the nine years that I should have killed myself. I have been living with depression for most of my life, I'm trying to remember when it wasn't there but that would be denying a part of myself, which is how it thrives.  It's guided a lot of what I do and arguably that is all I know. I am stepping into this whole me thing, wholistic, mediation, letting others know what's going on with my depression. It's difficult, and it likes that. 

So why my birthday? I don't like it, it reminds me of what I was too much of a coward to do. Happens every year, it's like my body and mind knows, it's our birthday, time to remember what we didn't do... and guess what your still walk with this shadow.

I feel like I pin my laziness on my Depression too much. At a certain point it's just me. I hate it. Even if it is just a symptom of my Depression, I don't care I just want to fix it. 

I've failed one class last semester purely because of procrastination. I'm failing two classes this semester because this whole semester I couldn't be bothered to actually show up to class. The number of times I did show up can be counted on one hand. Some days I don't do anything but stay in bed, all day. Not even getting out to eat. I have a huge problem with procrastination and playing video games. It's killing my academic success. My meds make my libido go through the roof and it makes me spend hours looking at porn (this is really hard for me to admit and talk to my doctors about). I didn't used to be like this. I graduated high school with a 4.3 GPA. I'm not stupid but I feel like complete crap for failing. 

This summer I want to get better. I wanna fix this. How do I do that? I landed a paid internship in the field that I want to pursue a career in when I graduate. I've never had a job before. I think the structure will be good for me. Other than that I'm taking some online classes. How do fix myself before the start of next semester? I want to be better. This is the plan I have laid out for myself:

1. Spend two hours on online classes per day (one hour per class). 
2. Spend one hour reading and *hopefully* finish my reading list before summer ends. I won't be that bummed out if I don't finish the list. 
3. Go through my exercise routine once a day. Part of a longer run goal to get my weight back down to 150-160 lbs.
4. Don't let myself play any video games until I've completed all of the above for the day. 
5. Stop drinking sodas, or at least stick with diet sodas
6. Resume going to therapy once a week (I've neglected my mental health throughout the year).
7. Do debate drills every weekend. I do competitive debate for my college and did it all throughout highschool. It makes me happy. 

This plan is nice and everything but I know I'm gonna fail at some point. It's okay to fail sometimes, that's not what I'm afraid of.

It's destroying my life and I don't have any means to get away from it...","Here I am; never known I'd have to post here but my life is a whole mess. Two days after valentines day, my then girlfriend went at a bar with friends to drink and party. she then managed to wake me up at 2 AM to take her pillows in my room (we are roomates with a room each but her pillows were in my room), being noisy and disruptive. She tells me in a hurry that someone's here and she's gonna go to sleep in her room. While I try to wake up, get explanations and stop her all at once, she run away to her room. there, she rips the bedsheets; the force having thrown the matress on the ground. as i see that scene while going to the bathroom, I turn around and find myself staring at an ass not belonging to my girlfriend, thrusting her in pleasure. traumatized, depressive and powerless, i go back to my room in tears and pop about thrice the reccomended dose of sleep pills and start sobbing in tremor and panic.

Flashback's over and we're now in may. college is about to end and i failed two classes already without having to take any exams, my grades are astronomically low and i cant concentrate. I am still living with my ex and i have no way of moving away because i had already signed for another year. i now suffer from anxiety, depression, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts and rare hallucinations. my ex has now destroyed my life; she was all that I had as friend, lover and human presence. I am now alone and never talking to anyone, having failed too many times at getting a friend. I am now at the point where i am posting on /r/depression, and this is a milestone I never hoped to have..

287,1494108653,Allison87,I've forgiven myself.,"I'm going through a divorce. I tried really hard to make my marriage work but it failed, and I didn't even know why. Plus my therapist told me I have depression syndrome and it's probably been more than two years. You can imagine how frustrated I was. 

But I just realized that it's not that I'm not cut out for marriage, it was because my soon-to-be-ex-husband has always treated me with his passive-aggressive attitude. 

At the first two years of our relationship everything seemed ok, as time went by some of my behaviors started to annoy him. But instead of telling me ""Please don't do that"" he chose the worst way in marriage to deal with our relationship - not to talk, not to respond, not to collaborate. 

I didn't realize it before because I wanted to geve him space, because he was really busy with his job and had a complicated even traumatizing relationship with his mother. Anyway, our relationship deteriorated, and now we're getting a divorce. Now I know that my marriage never had a chance from the day he started using passive-aggression to defend himself, to counter-annoy me, to control our relationship. 

More importantly, now I know where my frustration and rage came from. I've always deemed myself as an optimistic, positive person, so when I was told and then actually reallized to be having depression I couldn't forgive myself. I didn't kniw where they came from, I didn't know how to get better. Now I know the answers clearly, because one's passive-aggressive attitude does that to others.

So now, I forgive myself.",/r/depression/comments/69nvc0/ive_forgiven_myself/

I'm 21, been suffering from anxiety and depression for 7-8 years now but lately it has gotten unbearable. Over the years I've gotten away with medicating myself with alcohol, tobacco, pills, weed, drugs you name it I did. Anything to keep my mind off of my pointless and stressful existance.

  I survived like this until January this year when I lost my job, my car died, and my girlfriend left me. For the last four months I have had no money, no motivation and I just sit at home all day doing drugs. Well I'm sick of feeling like this. I can't leave my house and even if I could I have no where to go. My roommates don't talk to me, my family hasn't spoken yo me in forever. I literally do nothing but wake up and then sleep again. Over and over. 

 I would love to see a doctor but I am flat broke, no health insurance, and the only free mental health clinic in my state is shut down and under investigation. 

 What the fuck do I do? My phone bill is past due so it will be disconnected soon. I can't pay rent or bills which are due next week. And o have absolutely no one to reach out to. I've tried going to churchs, schools, anywhere and everyone just tells me ""you can do it!"" Or ""try to find a hobby!"".

To clarify, I don't mean ""crashing at someone's place"" homeless, I mean ""living on the street"" homeless. No family or friends to bail me out, I'm completely on my own.

Job searching is just about the most depressing, soul-crushing thing I've ever dealt with. And that's saying something because I went through 2 years of pure hell in grad school. No relevant experience (which is pretty much the only thing employers care about these days, degrees aren't worth the paper they're printed on), barely able to meet the minimum job application requirement for unemployment benefits, etc. Combined with my lifelong depression, I just don't want to think about it most days. A good day for me is just distracting myself with video games and not dealing with reality anymore. Every weekday I talk to recruiters and have to eat my daily slice of humble pie, and every time I go outside my apartment I look down the balcony and realize one day I may have to use it.

I feel like everyone else is cut from a different cloth than me. They can all get jobs, why can't I? They can all stay afloat with their finances, why can't I? I mean, I have a master's degree in computer science, it's not like I graduated in underwater basket weaving. Why can't I prove my worth? Why can't I be given a chance? It feels like society itself is rejecting me, saying ""Go away, you worthless loner. You have nothing to offer. Why don't you just go die already?""

Met with some friends from middle school, met with some friends from the Internet, changed schools and finally - started living more than just home. 

And that's why I decided to donate my blood. Saw an ad for mobile ambulance for donating. I was really excited for this whole thing, you know, because back in the day I liked helping people; spent some time in a queue just to hear I can't donate because I'm diagnosed with depression. I knew there was a chance they would deny me, but I thought that would happen because of meds and not illness itself. 

So yeah, felt pretty horrible, didn't even ask why people with depression aren't allowed to donate blood and just went to cry in a stupid public bathroom. Guess I should've expected that. Even now I still want to cry thinking about it, even though it's not that big of a deal. 

But hey, at least I'm planning to met with another friend from the Internets, going for a train just in a few hours and that's pretty uplifting for me I guess.

325,1494115462,Throwaway-SadPanda,My postpartum story I'm too afraid to tell,"Part 1:
I am terrified of having another baby. It's not that I'm afraid of giving birth or the terrible two's but rather the fear that my mental health will deteriorate beyond repair. 

When my son was born a few years ago I was sad. I stared at the tiny boy in utter disbelief that I've created someone so perfect but I couldn't understand why it felt like somebody died. I put it down to the baby blues and attempted to drown it with chocolate. The first week was scary. Breastfeeding is hard, period, but it's even harder when your baby won't wake up. Eventually, amongst the tears, he latched after a few days. By this point I was beyond exhausted. I got 8 hours sleep in 5 days and I started seeing dolphins swimming around my house. I was pretty certain that I was the only person who could see them so I finally went to bed. The early days were tough. I was so focussed of my son that every time I looked up to my husband I almost jumped out my skin because he looked like a giant. My little boy couldn't regulate his temperature and it scared me to death. When he went too cold he would stop responding and not wake up until he warmed up. When he was warm the SID's advice of ""cold babies cry, hot babies die"" played in my head over and over and over again. I can't begin to describe how badly I took that SID's advice. All I heard was that if I went to sleep, ever, my baby would die and I wouldn't even know. The more tired I got, the more my mind twisted things and the less I slept. I wasn't sure I was safe to drive, I certainly couldn't string a sentence together, but I carried on regardless. The SID's advice still results in me checking if my son is breathing before I go to bed every single night years later.

For the first 6 months we had a very colicky and unhappy baby. It took months before our families visited to meet our son. We had no support and my partner started showing classic signs of Postnatal depression. I didn't recognise it at the time and took it that I was the only person in the whole world that cared about this tiny little person. I focussed harder and harder on my son and I'm sure my partner felt more and more neglected. Our relationship became strained and my partner had a hard time bonding with our baby. One day he tried to spit in his face (he's a great dad don't worry - this was his lowest point) - I stopped him but something in my head flipped. I despised, loathed, hated him. I hated my best friend. I couldn't even stand looking at him.  After a while my view on things got worse. I was convinced that the person who I've been with for more than 10 years was suddenly a psychopath. I couldn't let him be the last person who checked on my son before we went to sleep. I was terrified that he would suffocate him with a pillow or find another quiet way to stop him from breathing. Every time he checked on him last I would get up to go to the loo so I could make sure our baby was still breathing. I hated going to sleep before my partner too. What if he got up to check on our son without me knowing? Or what if he wanted to hurt/kill me in my sleep? I became chronically sleep deprived. I later started watching self defence videos on you tube and would check our bedroom for any hidden weapons. Typing this right now seems surreal... My stress levels hit a record high but I was far too afraid to tell anybody since I was convinced a social worker would take my son away and my world would end. I started wondering how I could just disappear with my son and what we would do without any support. After several months of this I put an anonymous post of the internet asking people if they thought my husband was a narcissist. Somebody nicely pointed out that even though somebody can be an asshole sometimes it doesn't mean they're a psychopath. I started seriously questioning my judgement but I couldn't get myself to stop pushing my partner further away just in case I was still right. Later I convinced myself that he hated me instead. I asked him why he hates me so much and if he wanted to break up with me. I got an extremely confused look and he ended up asking me if I was trying to end our relationship. I wasn't and at this point I stopped trusting my judgement altogether. I haven't made a single big decision since that day. At this point I thought I was fine.",/r/depression/comments/69oetm/my_postpartum_story_im_too_afraid_to_tell/

I don't want to call it depression because other people have it so much worse than me, and also because I've never been diagnosed. I think I've had depressive episodes in the past, but this one has been particularly rough. 

It's hard to articulate how I feel but it's just been really hard these past few months. My self esteem is worse than ever, both in my character and in my physical appearance. I feel insecure in a lot of my friendships and I feel like nobody really wants me around. Even when I'm hanging out with them, there's still a lingering thought that I'm just being a nuisance to them. I haven't told anybody about this because I don't want them to be annoyed with me. I've been either sleeping a lot or self medicating with drugs and alcohol. I feel useless and it wouldn't make a difference in the world if I was gone or not.

330,1494115963,StonedZombieUK,After the fall,"So as I'm sure you are aware by coming to this thread I am a person living with depression.

I had my first episode 4 years ago.

My journey may be one you too have gone through;

*The Journey*

- Divorced parents from a young age 

For me it began when I was 3, The break up was calm to begin with I would have regular visits and trips with my dad whilst living with my mum. This stopped aged 8 as my dad found a new partner who seemed nice but eventually revealed herself to be an alcoholic. She forced my dad to leave work to pick her drunk body up out the street, she smashed a mug over his head whilst he was sleeping, and she threatened to kill me and my mum if I ever went to visit him again.

- Bullied at school

For me it was my obviously large ears, which knocked my confidence and lead to a lack of confidence in my speech. I would mumble or start a sentence and stop because I felt noone cared or they would laugh at what I had to say. This bullying continued from year 1 to year 10. I moved primary schools to get away from the kids who used to bully me only to meet them again in secondary school. I used to get beat up all the time. Sometimes my fault for getting angry and lashing out but mostly because the other kids found it 'fun'.

I was given the advice, ignore them and they will go away. HA! 

- The Spiral

I started smoking aged 13 because it gave me a chance to get on the same side as these kids. They say smoking doesn't make you cool but that's bullshit. This worked and my final 2 years of school (10-11) went smoothly-ish. There were still a few kids who picked on me but I now had people who I knew would come and stick up for me.

My head was so damaged from this childhood that by the time GCSE's came around I had lost all interest in school. I didn't fail them but I didn't try either. I'm a smart kid (not to be too narcissistic) I could have gotten A's in at least a few subjects but I scraped through with C's and a D.

By this point my home life was starting to fall apart. My mum remarried when I was young and I have 2 half-brothers. I never felt part of this new family as it always felt like my step-dad cared more about them than me (I understand his side a little I am not his child but he stepped up and became a father figure for me) I felt excluded as my 2 brothers went to private school whilst I was shipped to the local state school. 

- The Drugs

I started smoking cannabis and drinking in year 10. I guess looking back it was a release for me, a chance to get away from my bottled up 'trauma'. This lead to arguments between me, my mum &amp; my step-dad. I was kicked out of the home and made homeless before I finished my GCSE's and missed my maths exam because of this.

My mum phoned my dad (who had since broken up with his alchy ex and found a lovely new woman he would go on to marry (She is an wonderfully kind and caring human being).I lived with him for 2 years.

My 'release' problem spiralled and I, over the course of these 2 years, I began taking MDMA, Cocaine, Ketamin, ACID, Shrooms etc. I got in trouble with the police, never going to jail but coming close. 

- The Trigger

I met this girl and long story short she got pregnant. We told the parents, mine and hers. There was no support. I got connected and wanted to keep it but again long story short, abortion. 

This fucked me. 

I lost my will to live and began using and drinking to even more excess than before. I wanted to numb the pain and I didn't care if it killed me. I tried to commit suicide but ended up in hospital where the doctors declared me to have Depression, PTSD &amp; Anxiety. I continued my 'release'.

- The Uphill struggle

This eventually got too much for my dad as it put strain on his new relationship (He married during these 2 years) I was kicked out and sent to my Grandparents who took care of me and helped me through my detox, I got clean (besides the occasional joint and a line during social events like birthdays). 

This was a huge step up the ladder for me and I would say it was the time I began to see the light at the end of this mental prison. I got a job, moved into my own place, yadda yadda 2 more years, I noticed every so often, in maybe 4 - 6 month periods that I felt myself regaining control. I could focus on a goal and take steps to achieve it.

To this day I suffer from Anxiety attacks and I still have down days. I now feel like this is a burden from my past that I am prepared to move on from but it doesn't want to unwrap it's tentacles from my mind. It keeps dragging me back. I fight and win (it can range from a few mins to hours to days to 2 weeks at a time).

- The Question

How do you cope with the (what I like to call) Aftermath? After you have found the ladder, and climbed up out of the pit?

I do not feel I am out of the hole but I can certainly see the sun, smell the air and hear the birdsong.

What can I do to stop myself slipping? I still feel numb, I have emotions but they sometimes feel fake or forced. I try to seem interested in other people but most of the time I want to be alone, with music or games, away from the world.

How can I fully recover?

Thank you for your responses in advance.

Edit: I might as well add the fact that there is part of me that wants to die still but I have repressed it for the sale of other people. I am alive for them not for me. As I saw another user post: ""I want to die but I will not kill myself.""",/r/depression/comments/69og98/after_the_fall/
331,1494116013,PseudoPsychotropical,Lots of depression and anxiety around my appearance.,"I was going to post on one of the fashion subreddit's but then sort of realized this is probably more of a mental health thing. 

I'm just feeling really overwhelmed and depressed about dressing myself and looking at myself. I've tried to look through blogs and stuff and ultimately a lot of sources suggest finding inspiration or stuff you like but it leads to this cycle of depression because 1.) Nothing really stands out to me. I feel like I don't like anything because I'm not a real person like other people. or 2.) Nothing looks or feels right on me or it just looks different and I feel like it's not the clothes, it's that there is  just something deeply wrong with me. 

I've never been that into fashion and I was isolated as a teenager so I guess missed that experimental phase. I don't know I don't know how to get passed it to feel more confident because the whole process is so stressing. it just seems like it shouldn't be so hard.

I can't be the only one who thinks this...,"Over the years I began to hate summer break (still in school by the way) because of how lonely it made me feel. But when school rolls around and I start hanging around with my friends again, my self esteem would plummet. My best friends are everything I wish I could be. They're beautiful, they're smart, they're nice, etc... in other words, they're pretty much perfect  (or at least that's how I see them as). Being with them makes me see myself even worse than before. I begin to despise myself for how I look, act, and overall who I am as a person. It's gotten to a point when I feel like crying whenever I see myself in the mirror. And no matter what I do, all I think about is how worthless I am and how I'm never good enough.

339,1494116911,Mr_LifeSeeks,Is 21 years old too young to give up on life?,"I'm 21 and my entire life has been a joke, no life actually...

I'm still a virgin, never had a girlfriend, kissed, or dated. Never had many friends, went years with literally no friends. Sucked academically. Now struggling just to get an entry level minimum wage job. 

I live in capitalist America, so I can't have any kind of life until/unless I am able to get a job and hold it long-term, and make a decent income. I am lonely, depressed, paranoid, and sexually frustrated, and more. 

While you could argue that everyone would be in prison or killed if their thoughts were readable, if you knew mine, you'd probably be vomiting everywhere and calling your local law enforcement to track me and have me locked up for life, some people would try to track me themselves to come and kill me. 

I'm honestly kind of surprised that I haven't had the FBI or even the local police come knocking on my door to talk to me. 

There's no way that ALL of my thoughts would be responded to with ""Actually, everyone thinks that way, that's normal."" Even if my thoughts are normal, they're still hell and my life is hell (no actual life).

Night time is when the worse happens, I actually lock my door to be safe so I can cry privately, and continue to hide my real problems from my family. 

I don't feel I will even be safe telling a psychiatrist everything, because since I don't live on my own yet, I won't be able to hide everything. Obviously something IS WRONG if I am being involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital, I won't be able to hide the fact that I have serious problems then, it will be obvious I'm hiding problems if a doctor has decided to have me forced into a facility to get help. Also, I highly believe that I would simply be put in, put on some new meds, kept for a few days or week..... then released and be right back to needing employment and struggling to get it, and nothing will have changed, I will just have had a short vacation (I have sometimes seriously considered faking a breakdown to get committed just to be around other people and socialize, at some point I might not have to fake a breakdown though) and I will be right back to where I was before I was involuntarily committed, still in need of a solution to fix my life (lack of life) and continue being stuck in my situation without a solution.",/r/depression/comments/69oiz8/is_21_years_old_too_young_to_give_up_on_life/
340,1494117421,[deleted],You know you really don't give a shit when porn doesn't even arouse you anymore while fully loaded.,"This is a new disassociation from reality for me.

I just watched it for 5 minutes trying to feel some type of arousal, and I just don't even give a shit about a girl with big tits sucking some guy's dick.

Of course society would say ""You're turning gay bro,"" or ""That's really weird that hot women no longer arouse you."" Well, why should I be aroused by something that life will never, ever give me; something impossible to for some people like me to get? I think my mind has simply adjusted to and accepted this reality. I just don't give a shit about anything anymore. It's impossible to look forward to the future when you're bound to be doomed and betrayed by whoever the hell is out there. And whoever the hell is out there, go to hell.

350,1494119165,MetalMurse,The loneliness is getting unbearable,"I'm finishing college in less than two weeks and I've got literally no friends to celebrate with. I've only got one final left and I can perform abysmally on it and still pass. I'm graduating from a small, closely-knit 4 year nursing program BUT I'm the outsider to everyone else. Everyone's got their circles and I'm in mine alone. Admittedly, I lacked all confidence in my social skills when I started college (after I was relentlessly bullied for six straight years) but I overcame my awkwardness and lack of confidence. This wasn't until I made a terrible impression on literally every professor and classmate and became known as the guy who lacks any ability to communicate. I haven't had ever had a girlfriend and I've never had any real friends. I've been used by people who acted nice to me when they needed help from me and then was either treated like I don't exist or treated like shit.

My parents have outwardly stated that having meaningful relationships is not something that you need in life (They aren't just talking about at my age) yet they're only know starting to regret making two friends. As for my siblings, my relationship with my older sister is essentially in tatters because she couldn't stand my awkwardness and my relationship with fraternal twin (I'm a guy, she's a girl) isn't as close as I thought. She's tried to get me out of my shell but when I express the disgust I have for myself, she shrugs them off. The worst is my extended family. They all poke fun at me for how I used to be. And I swear, I'm not awkward anymore. I'm much more social than I've ever been I just can't create any fucking relationships.

The only thing I've been able to do well in my entire life is academics. I wake up exhausted and I'm screaming on the inside at nearly every turn and I can't stand it. I've progressively become more and more moody (E.g, the massive hole in my wall at home, covered up by a painting). When I see my siblings able to with their friends and their significant others and actually form lasting relationships, it kills me. This isn't out of jealously but it just makes me wonder. What's wrong with me? Why I can't I do that? I'm just that revolting to everyone else? It's gotten to the point that whatever confidence I built up over my time in college is being chipped away. 

I have no idea what to do now. I'm going out into a world where I've got no one to lean on. I'm starting to think that no matter what, there will be absolutely no point in me living. I can't stand the thought of how it's going to be in a few months. Come from a 12 hour shift taking care of patients for three days and staying in the house by myself for the other four days?

Don't tell me I'm young and that I have my whole life ahead of me. I feel like an old man with the mind of an empty 6 year old trapped in a 19 year old body. This is how I have always felt.

They say depression makes you have worse memory. I couldn't identify with that more. I feel like I have no past. Every memory I have is a fragment with no meaning. I have forgotten every ""skill"" I have ever accumulated. I can't do anything and feel like I know nothing. I have never felt emotions since my depression started. I learned not to feel when I was 6. I am nothing. I wake up every day empty and go to sleep even emptier. I don't know what it feels like not to be depressed.

I am an invisible human. I'm convinced I don't exist. My life is just a countdown until I kill myself. I have lived my entire life seeking escape. Death is the ultimate escape.",/r/depression/comments/69oqng/i_am_the_most_pathetic_worthless_person_on_this/

I just feel blank. It's the only way to explain it. I'm a very sociable person but would rather stay home and be by myself. I talk to a small group of friends I've grown up with but when it comes to hanging out with them I would rather just not. No matter the good things that's happened in life i always just feel.... blank.. still depressed.. worthless. I have a well paying job and just gotten married to my wonderful wife last month which I thought would make me feel better but again the feeling returned... I fake a smile all the time so nobody notices the ""weirdness"". I just don't know what to do at this point. I've talked to my doctor years ago about it and she gave me prescription but I hated the side effects.. maybe I should try therapy or something but I just have no clue how to deal with the depression and thoughts of worthlessness and seclusion.

355,1494119992,bsa13,How to cope with skin scars causing depression.,"Hello, as a child i was irresponsible and contracted a skin rash that left small scars all over my body. The scars make me insecure and prevent me from social interactions specifically approaching women because i know that when they find out about the scars they probably wouldn't be interested in me.  The scars are most visable on my chest, thighs, and arms. Basically anywhere clothing touched helped the rash thrive on my skin. 

Going through life with the belief that I'll never be able to interact with attractive women in an intimate way is really depressing. I feel hopeless, like my future is destined to be alone and unsatisfying which leads me to not really enjoy going out. 

I haven't had a females opinion on my skin besides my mom and of course she says ""It's not that bad"" but i know it is. 

How do people cope with skin related depression?

Should i just put myself out there, deal with the inevitable rejection, learn to cope with my condition? 

Any tips, advice or stories will help. Thanks.

my last gf dumped me because of my problems after a 6 1/2 year relationship. i dont think i have to tell u how this feels. 2 meters from me sleeps the most beatiful girl i have ever seen. shes my girlfriend for about a year now. she knows about my condition and tries to help me every step of the way. im hopefully going to finish my bachelors in the next few months and try to take that as a step towards the right direction. the thing is, besides of these positive things.
i dont feel like living. i dont feel like waking up in the morning. i dont feel like working. i dont wanna study. i just want my peace. thats the way depression stares at me. 
all i want and all i ever wanted was time to be alone. sadly thats not how this world works. i know that but i refuse to accept it. so thats my live. 
sometimes im in a good mood. most of the time i dont want to talk to anybody. i write poems, because of course. i have a diary. non of that makes me a happy person. but sometimes, because of these things i feel like a person. not a happy one, but a ""working"" one. i dont know if this helps anyone. just wanted to share.

I have seen how the internet and places like Imgur and Reddit help people out in times of need, so I figured what the hell, I am going to die alone at this rate so why not.

Backstory if you are interested, I'm 28, live in the UK and live with my parents with no job, and quite possibly no job aspects with no qualifications to boot. Single, never had a meaning relationship, and to find any kind of romance, I have to pay a working girl, I'm that ugly. Was bullied and mentally fucked over for 17 years straight. Every. Single. Day. And just to add to all the Fuckery, I also have Autisum, Ashburgers, ADHD, Hyperhydrosis (Exessive sweating), Depression and possibly a bunch of other crap that even I don't know about.

I have no friends to call my own, I'm just so alone, I cry myself to sleep every night hugging a pillow because I have no one. Even writing those words make me cry, I'm trying to hold back tears and be strong but if anyone knew what it's like to have your mother try to comfort a grown man just because he is lonely, do people even understand the embarrassment of that thought alone?

I get mini panic attacks when I go outside because of the hyperhydrosis especially if there are women around me, sometimes I just wanna run away and lock myself in my room becuase I think they are making fun of me or laughing at me cuz of the sweating because I walked 5 feet and I'm dripping in sweat.

365,1494122507,B_hawk00,My story of being a depressed hopeless romantic. (TL;DR at end),"As noted in the title, I'm a hopeless romantic. This is more of a curse when you're like me. I'll admit, I don't have the worst looks. I mean, I'm probably a 6/10 and (according to some pretty cute chicks) I have a personality ""to die for"". 

Now, what's bad about this is I fall for someone so easily. It is the most simple thing that I do, second is breathing. The only time I can't fall for someone is if I meet someone I'm dead set on being with. I'm in that situation now.

Last October I joined my 5th band, Åndssvak, and the drummer is this girl who I used to like a year before ( It was around August 2015). She was dating the lead guitarist who also happened to be my best friend at the time. One night at a practice, he went to this guys house who I totally hate to go get high with them. My social awkwardness told me ""go hide in his bedroom until he gets back"" because he didn't invite his girlfriend. She came to me and said ""we can go back to my house if you'd like"" so I went.This was the first time I've ever been at a girls house. I remember every detail so goddamn vividly. We dropped the boyfriend off and drove to her house. We went into her room and talked about music while watching the movie ""Fan Girl"", specifically the scenes with All Time Low since it's her favorite band. She then asked if i was interested in being a test dummy for her special effects makeup and of course I said yes. We sat on her floor and she made a nice fake cut on my hand. Then her boyfriend told her they're done early and to get him. So we left. On the drive we started having a very deep and personal conversation. She started venting to me about how her boyfriend is always ignoring her, and is moody and more. After I supported her I started reminiscing about an ex of mine (she cheated with me with 5 guys in 3 weeks) and we both sighed and said ""I wish I could find someone as clingy as me"" at the same time. Tell me that isn't only a sign but also a moment right out of a chick flick. I didn't pop a boner though so I'm pretty proud. Anyways we got back to the lead guitarists house after picking him up and we didn't talk the rest of the night because he's the jealous type.

This January he started treating her horribly and she stopped taking her anti-depressants. Between October and then we had a few conversations but nothing like this one. We talked and talked and talked and I calmed her down over everything that was happening. This happened from 11 PM to 4 AM on a Saturday night. Eventually I talked her into getting some rest and I stayed up until 5 AM in case she woke up because I told her to call me if she wakes up panicked.  That night wasn't just sad boyfriend venting, we both shared our memories about molestation and abuse and just anything we could think of. We both noticed we are practically the same person. I realized then, I'm in love with her. 

The following Monday we talked about the Saturday before and she told me she's never had a friend like me and just constantly telling me how amazing I am. But she still told me about her ""asshole boyfriend"". From then on we've been very close friend. For the past 3 months I've been going to her house almost every day just to be with her.

When I was younger, I had an issue with cutting myself, pointless suicide attempts and depression. Okay, maybe not pointless but I didn't approve of my actions afterwards. Anyways, I stopped doing that until last Saturday. I was at a family gathering and faced my rapist for the first time in 13 years. It felt like everything just came back at once. Just typing this makes my insides crumble. Of course I went to her for comfort and she tried comforting me but it wasn't the same. Since then I've been treating my left bicep down to my wrist like. Like. Well i dont know a good analogy here but I've treated it poorly. 3 days ago I tried overdosing on cocaine because I know someone who sells but that failed, I just cried and fell asleep. I told her because I felt so guilty. She comforted me and I haven't overcome that guilt. Last night I thought about shooting myself but started crying at the thought of her crying and then fell asleep. It's a horrible cycle of suicide, crying, and sleeping. 

I'm just so heartbroken. She still the closest person I have but it's the thought that I'll never be with her. I fucking love her so much. I've never been this much in love. I haven't masturbated since last October. I've tried but I just cant, I feel guilty. I can't even look at another girl in a sexual manner without feeling horrible. I'm just so in love with this girl. I want to marry her someday. I want to be with her forever. All the things she liked that I used to hate I now love because I convinced myself that I liked it. I  used to make fun of Twenty one pilots so much because all I listen to is old school punk, grunge and metal. I mean, shit. I'm listening to Pilots right now. I guess I'm telling you all this because I need to tell someone how I feel. She's at a wedding with a friend right now so I can't talk to her. Anyways, thank you for reading this.

I've pretty much always had this problem and it's only gotten worse in this heated political and social climate, to the point that what was once an occasional obsession has become an almost daily thing that takes hours out of my time and drives me further into loathing for me, the people around me, and occasionally with humanity I general. 

I've tried limiting my intake of media, but whenever I do so, I have this nagging thought in the back of my head that I'm being ignorant by choosing to ignore the awful things that happen around me.

I thank you in advance.

I am miserable and I really shouldn't be, I don't have a right to be. I have a beautiful wife and 2 year old daughter and anotger child on the way. I own a house (fully paid off) in the most desired livable places in the world making me worth millions in assets alone. Have also beautiful beach front holiday home I can retreat to whenever I want...so basically I am a man who has everything he needs and wants, yet I feel I am constantly suffering in my own head.

I have wealthy parents hence my wealth so nothing I own I have personally earnt. Maybe this is why? However I also know enough about depression that there isn't necessarily a single reason to feel this way...it is a mental illness. 

My problems centre around my working life. Do I need to work? Well regardless of my assets I still need to make an income to feed and support my own family...mummy and daddy aren't going to help with that. And here lies the problem with me.

I would say I am skilled. Since leaving high school I have done a number of qualifications. Telecommunications, Information Technology (network architect) and I am just now finishing my apprenticeship as an electrician (where I am from, we are the best trained in the world). However, although I have skills and my peers in these industries all earn upwards of 90k annually I am yet to have employment that pays higher than minimum wage in my entire working life. I have done so much skilled work for somebody else and have no financial gains to show for it.

I find my working life has been simply training for 15 years without any gains. I have had 10 jobs in the past 15 years, 9 of which I have been asked to leave. They all tell me the exact samething...'oh, sorry bud the company ain't doing to well and you don't seem to want to be here, we're gonna have to let you go'. This seems to happen on the 18 month mark almost like clockwork. I find when I undertake any sort of apprentiship I go through minimum 2 employers before completion. However with my electrical apprenticeship this will be my 3rd. It's not like I dont put in the effort. Most days I have been working are typically 11-12 hours. Night shifts on occasion requiring me to be back at work within 2 hours of my shift ending. I have done 24 hour shifts multiple times and this monday I am going to be doing a 17 hour day. 

So when a boss tells me some crap like 'we don't think you're putting in enough effort' or 'you dont seem like you want to be here' the anger is almost too much to bear. Based on the hours I had worled for some of those businesses, I had been there longer than the employers. I have come to the conclusion that hard work gets you absolutely fucking nothing. So don't be a fool if you think you gain any sort of browny points for pushing these ridiculous hours like i was.

Currently I have been doing my own work on the side so I can make more than minimum wage. I am workin 12 hours a day 7 days a week just to get by. In my day job I only get paid for 8 but on weekends those 12 hours almost net me my entire weekly wage eith one problem...I am burnt out. Suddenly death seems really appealing...i'd like think im not suicidal but it just seems so peaceful. It obviously is not an option because I love my daughter and wife so much that I wpuld suffer an eternity for them. However all this work is now making me resent them a little bit for taking my attention for the little timr I'm not working.

I simply come home and my daughter wants me to play with her and my wife wants me to talk. I really cant do either. I come home and stare into space consumed by anxiety about going back to work in a few hours. 

I cant stand sleeping as I just know that means I lose all that time. Not only that but I feel lile absolute shit when I wake up. Can't stomach food in the mornings (I throw up) so my breakfast consists of coffee and about 3 or 4 cigarettes. Then after my extremely unhealthy wake up ritual I start my day of hard physical labour, risking electrocution and other worksite hazards whilst getting screamed at for minimum 12 hours all for minimum wage. Then I go home and let my anxiety consume me for another night.

My wife and I went out the other night to see the Aladdin stage show. I use to love going to the theatre with her but this was torture. It was the first time I had been out in public other than for work in about 6 months. I couldn't stand it. All these happy people around me taking selfies and yapping. I felt like screaming at everyone. I was so anxious an full of what I can omly describe as pure rage. My wife said she could hear me grinding my teeth and my face was extremely red. Aparently veins were shoong on my neck. I fucking hated it. Needless to say I have not left the house for anything other than work since. 

I am ignoring people including my own family now and slipping pretty badly. I look to the future and all I see is work. It all just seems so exhausting. I look to the past and all I see is regret and wasted time. Also knowing that my pessimistic views will probably kill me long before I get the chance to retire let alone cigarettes.

Cigarettes actually seem to be the only thing I focus on to get through the days. It is my little break for 2 minutes while I quickly suck it down. They actually do nothing for me but I have associated them with relaxing or stopping work so they are my go to excuse. I am also smoking pot just so i can turn off the anxiety switch before I go to bed. I am in the worst cycle. However I don't drink do at least I'm not heading down the path of alcoholism.

In the end my life is spiralling out of control or at least in my own head. I can't stand the general public, I am finding myself ignoring my friends and family and doing everthing in my power with the little energy I have to avoid all kinds of interaction with human beings just so I can be consumed by anxiety alone.

I don't make enough to live in the city where the school is. 

I don't have enough time left over from my position at the university as well as pursuing the actual degree to get a second job. 

I live over an hour away with my parents. I am 26. 

I should say ""parent""-- they spent this past year getting divorced and dragging my sibling and I through an emotional manipulative hell.

I won't be living there much longer, because the bank is taking everything. 

I don't have a place to go. 

Several times over the past year I've had plans to move in with friends-- get an apartment, rent a house-- and every time these plans have fallen through. In part because everyone I know makes more than me now-- they got real jobs out of college-- and in part because no one wants to live with a depressed adult student. 

The man I came to this program to study under retired. Explicitly told me he would not direct my dissertation. 

It's still unclear if I'll be able to pursue research in the actual specific topic I came to this school to study. 

If I do, recent events have weakened the reputation of my school-- in an already horrible market, if I even make it to defending, it's more and more unlikely I could ever get a job. 

And this semester was the first time I've taught a grade other than freshmen. I discovered that we don't, in fact, have any effect. I teach writing. The seniors wrote like freshmen. We're degree factories. 

As an undergraduate, books gave me a reason not to kill myself. I thought that I would be helping people see the real beauty and value of books. Instead it turns out the job is to make it look like teens learned what a paragraph is, even when this is not the case. Especially when this is not the case. 

I don't have any other skills. I don't have any experience. My only jobs have been writing teacher and physics tutor. And I ended up not getting a physics degree, so that's a dead end. I write, and I submit, but I've only ever received form-letter rejections.

I should try and see someone for depression. But the last time I went to a doctor, he ran through the classic 20 questions of ""do you have this? Do you have that?"" and when we got to depression, in response to ""I don't know-- I haven't been diagnosed"" I was told ""have you tried to kill yourself? No? YOU DON'T HAVE DEPRESSION."" And my insurance is so crappy there's no way I could afford anything. 

Now when I think about dying, it doesn't seem bad. My family has splintered and gone their own ways. My friends have for the most part either gotten married or started careers. My contract will be up for teaching soon, so I won't have professional obligations-- and it's not like I was achieving anything there anyway. Again, degree factory. There's no romantic obligations tying me down-- I haven't been on a date in two years. 

The one thing is that I'm going to be in someone's wedding, and I'm not so selfish/self-absorbed to do anything that would distract from that day. If I did anything it would be after. 

Likely even then I wouldn't kill myself. I don't know. 

It just feels like there's nothing, on any level, for me to hope for-- on the level of family, economics, professional life, personal, there's nothing. And the people I have ties to are moving more and more into their own productive, fruitful, individual lives, so I wouldn't feel as bad about leaving everything. 

The one thing is I wish I could do it in such a way that nobody would know-- I'd prefer my old friends ask ""whatever happened to that guy?"" and not be able to find out, than ask ""why did he do it?""

379,1494125123,Throwmeaway5554,"Need advice, I'm lost","I'm a university student finishing my second year in university. I've been depressed and on meds for almost 5 years now.
 I have absolutely 0 zero friends and the only actual conversation i have with another human is with my dad every couple of weeks which basically consists of how long the meds are going to last before he needs to send some more (i study abroad). 
 I spend 99% of my time locked in my room and the remaining 1% running to the shop to get sugar free drinks. I'm not kidding,  i was anorexic for a time and my diet consisted of sugar free soft drinks, energy drinks and caffeine and i still can't function without them even though i am at a healthy weight now. 
 My attendance is absolutely horseshit barely topping 50% since i can't muster the strength to get out of bed most of the time. 
 I'm feel like I'm wasting away being here with noone to talk to while digging through my shirts on the floor to find something 'clean' to wear to run to the shop.
 Thing is i managed to get a job for the summer back home as a prep cook for a relatively high end restaurant. I used to love to cook even though here my nutrition is still energy drinks and caffeine. 
I'm considering dropping out of uni going back home and just try to climb the ladder in the restaurant industry as a new beginning. Try to meet people and such.

This is a void, an itching, buzzing, tingling sensation that rips through my consciousness every waking minute of every day. I'm in pain. It hurts. It hurts, but not in a way that would make conventional medical intervention any useful. It hurts in a deeper way. I feel like my brain has turned to mush. My head feels heavy with a fucked up brain inside. It feels like it's in my teeth. And then it feels like it's pushing against my brain, like a tumor. Only this tumor spews a never - ending sensation of emptiness and pain. A burning, buzzing pain that radiates throughout my head every second of every day, that I carry with me everywhere I go. I'm usually only safe from it in my dreams. Notice I said usually. While it seems like the minds of others spew out creativity and originality, all mine spews out is this fucking void of emptiness and darkness. I don't know what to call this. I could assign a psychiatric label to it, or even some other term. I could make up my own language and try to describe this. I may as well because it seems like nobody around me understands this anyway. Not my family, my psychiatrist, my friends. I don't know what to do about this. This hell follows me wherever I go. I don't know what I did to deserve this. I don't think I've been that bad in this life. Is this a punishment or something? Will it only end when I die? What do I do? Just keep working a dead end job that barely let's me survive and keep kinda going to school? I want a life without this feeling. Without this pain. Is that so much to ask for?

I'm 23. God help me if I'm in a similar position when I'm 33. 

For instance, I was just looking at pictures of myself from the summer of 2015, and my twisted brain yearns for those supposedly rosy days, I guess because I wasn't as bald then as I am now and was also in semi-regular contact with more people. 

But I was also a miserable drunk and I was still in the depths of my eating disorder and I was still smoking and hating myself for it. And I had gotten a DUI not six months prior to this period. Didn't wreck my car or kill anyone, by the way, but I nearly did. 

Guess this is just the way the brain works sometimes—the depressed brain, especially. Overlook the bad parts and focus on the few supposedly positive aspects, while minimizing their shortcomings. The ""friends"" I had back then, for example. Primarily, they were people I hung out with in order to get easier access to intoxicants. We enabled each other. I'm probably better off now that I don't hang out with them anymore. And yet, I spend much more time in solitude, which is not an ideal state of being for anyone, let alone someone prone to depression. 

That's all. Just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of lamentation that is this sub. Thanks for reading.

Also, today marks four years and two days since my great uncle died. We were close and I cleaned for him weekly. I finally stepped in his house today, first time since he died.

400,1494127258,GenericUsername69-,My depressive depression story,"Ok opening line to hook the reader - Im a 21 year old guy and my life sucks literal dick (like if you listened hard enough you'd actually hear the sounds of my life fondling some balls), and I live in England and I think thats probably the important base info to setup my character. ""Nailed it.""

To start off we gonna get real good this is gonna be like scene where the Rebels are boarded by the Empire and everyone dies but IRL and this actually happened. Anyway when I was 3 years old as I wasnt at school when this happened and I dont think my parents broke up until after I was 2 so I'm just guessing I was 3. But my mother and father broke up and my mother lived in a flat above a DIY store and one day my sister was playing with the store owners daughter in her room and being a kid i came in to join and although i dont remember much i just remember being told to tidy up for them despite only just walking in to which they threatened to tell the store owner as he was ""babysitting"" me and my sister after that all i remember is looking out the window and seeing him come in and upstairs, screaming at me then picking me up and kicking me into another room then the next thing i remember is waking up in a puddle of my blood. Then all i remember is cleaning it up then just sitting and staring at a wall until my mother came back. There was no Obi Wan and there was no hope so actually it was probably more like the opening to Empire Strikes Back.

After then I was insanely depressed and I have been ever since, after that I stopped talking to people, started doing everything on my own and just in general tried to keep on my own. When i started school although it wasnt immediately after starting I got bullied pretty badly (yeah i know you saw that coming and its a completely overused plot point for these stories), one memory I have is of some kid twice my size bare in mind i was about 4 at this point, who picked me up and threw me to the ground with lots of teachers watching, and they did nothing. But tbf it wasnt until I was 6 when everything got really bad as basically the entire school took up to bullying me, my ""friends"" started to single me out and just sorta ignore me. When i was 6 i also finally attempted suicide for the first time and obviously failed I did this by trying to hang myself in the school toilets but nothing was done besides the fact that someone had to accompany me everytime i went afterwards. Fun fact a few years later another kid in my school also attempted suicide because his cousin died and when the school found out they got him out of lessons so that he could undergo therapy which Ive never been able to understand why I was treat so differently. As the years went on the bullying got so bad that i used to ask people to hit me instead simply because it didnt hurt me as much.

Im probably forgetting something about my life in school from age 4-11 but I still need to explain the plot of my life at home. To which ill start with my dads side, from when he broke up with my mother things were pretty fine but around the time he met my step mother which was when I was about 5 everything got turned upside down. She was extremely abusive and it didnt take long but eventually my dad started to join in with it. When i was around my dads i never ate, they never made me food and when we went out food they never bought anything for me, i cant count the amount of times we were in a restaurant and i had to sit and watch my dad, step mother, sister and step brothers eat while i sat in silence and went to the toilets to cry, fun thing is we went back to the same place really often and they didnt notice the fact i never ate when i was there ever. I remember being terrified to ask my dad to use his pc to do my homework for school because one time when i went on it it froze and he beat me because of it, so i always got in trouble when i got homework that needed a computer. I remember being forced by them telling me theyd beat me with the buckle part of a belt if i didnt clean the house while they all went out. I literately never had a bed in my own room but my step brother's did as my room quickly became theirs. I never once got anything for my birthday and at christmas id get less than everyone else in my family did for their birthday.

Then on my mothers side youd expect that maybe id get a little bit of slack cut for me but instead i got a 3rd kind of abuse so it was pretty much a triple whammy between my life in school, at my dads and at my mothers. Where in school i was beaten and bullied and at my dads i was abused and beaten at my mothers i was also singled out for everything and lost control of everything i did in my life. Because my mother got with my step dad and they had a kid, and from the moment that kid was able to speak he would cause sh*t for me and lie, some things would make no sense but theyd believe him just because he was young and wouldnt be thinking like that. Whenever i did something that inconvenienced him or did something he didnt like hed tell them and id get shouted at because of it, and whenever he hit me or did something legitimately bad id hear ""WOW YOURE SO WHINY AND ANNOYING WHY CANT YOU JUST LEAVE YOUR BROTHER ALONE"" and if not when they actually confronted him because they were so stupid and his word meant more than mine hed lie and then again Id get shouted at. Id listen to them while they talked sh*t about me like i was some sort of problem child when i used to try my best to stay in my room alone and quiet but found it difficult when my brother was doing his best to make my life even more hell than what it was. So everyone i knew thought i was a horrible person. I mean a long time before this i remember injuring my foot on the way home from school and my mother surprise surprise screamed at me from the moment i injured my foot which for the record she saw happen to the moment i got home because i couldnt walk and was being slow all because she wanted to talk to her friend then later in life as i had problems with my foot ever since with it being weak now i tore the ligaments in my foot at school and got told by my doctor to give it atleast 2 weeks rest but the next day i was back at school and in intense pain. Funnily enough shortly after my brother fell over when coming home from school and pulled a muscle in his leg and he got to stay off school for 3 days when i was told i was lucky that i didnt need surgery. I used to cry myself to sleep every day and beg that if there was a god that i wouldnt wake back up, i used to hit myself all day everyday because i believed i deserved it and when my mother saw my bruises whether ones i did to myself or from school she just called me stupid. Oh and just to make you wonder how im alive whatsoever my mother wouldnt let me eat anything unless i ate the food they gave me for dinner which doesnt sound bad but the thing was they can't cook at all and everything they cooked was either undercooked or overcooked and 9/10 it was undercooked so if they made any chicken or fish or anything id get sick.

When i left school and started high school things got better at school atleast, people actually started to like me and thought i was funny even though everything was just as bad at home. Shortly after i started to not feel as depressed for the first time in my life when i was 12ish, however to compensate i finally got to experience my first ever anxiety attack which i thought i was dying and for months after i felt ill and assumed i had cancer, that i had a heart defect, that it was some black magic that after all the times i wished for death that now i finally wasnt as depressed i should die. But eventually it went, then came back for a few months then went and came back and then i finally realised when i was 15ish that it might just be anxiety.

But now finally we get to the point in my life that is keeping me depressed now. Obviously when i turned 13ish i started to realise i didnt want to be alone and i wanted to be loved by a girl and i really wanted to love someone back. Then not long after i saw a girl in my maths class and instantly fell in love and i was in love for years as it wasnt until i was 15 turning 16 that i finally asked her out and on facebook of all things and surprise surprise she turned me down and when she did i remember feeling empty, as for so long i felt so much love for a girl i had never spoke to, that when i finally got my answer from her i felt nothing and i felt nothing for a few months. Shortly after however my step mother had a friend who came to visit after a long while and she brought her daughters one of which i got kinda close to when i was 10 she stayed over for the day and was trying to get with me all day but i was so nervous nothing happened but the next day she said she wanted to spend her birthday the week later with me because i was ""hot""  the first compliment i ever got from a girl on my looks which was a huge surprise since i got called ugly by everyone when i was a kid. And sure enough when she came back i had my first kiss and although nothing much else happened she did kind of give me a HJ but i didnt finish. After then i got talking to her for a week or so afterwards in attempt to try and maybe get with her as in a relationship but eventually she stopped responding. Then shortly after that again one of the most attractive girls in my school started flirting with me because she thought i was ""strong"" as i started working out doing push ups and sit ups at home in an attempt to look more attractive to the girl i loved before. However although that went on for a while it turned out that she was just using me to get back at her boyfriend or ex boyfriend at the time. Then after a while i eventually met another girl who was really flirty with me, thought i was hilarious, always wanted to be with me and we were flirting back and forth for a while until i finally made a move and after that she got really bitchy with me as if i was an asshole to her when all i really did was think she was interested i mean she WAS flirting with me alot and was the one to start it.

After that i spent 2 years alone and lonely without anything from any girls even when going out drinking and clubbing. But finally i was gonna start uni and it was the one thing i believed would change my life. And i was right to some extent. Finally being away from my family i was for the first time in my life just okay with my life instead of depressed. I met a girl who i lived with in a flat and we got really close within days of meeting. Eventually after 3 months together at uni she broke up with her boyfriend because she wanted to be with me and the 2 weeks or whatever over xmas break i actually felt happy because for once in my life i had something to live for. But history was about to repeat itself because although she was really flirty with me before and REALLY flirty over xmas break when we finally met again she wanted nothing to do with me and was bitchy to me but still kinda wanted to be friends and we still were for the most part, this girl was the second girl i loved just so you know and then she friend zoned me which was fine but it was pretty annoying again since she acted like i was the best person in her life, told me she really liked me and that she broke up with her boyfriend for me. But i hit a new low for depression and the months following that xmas were probably the worst in my life as my room was next door to hers and she ended up getting with other guys to which she did the same to them too actually. However despite my depression somehow i got the motivation to start the gym again and i stook to it for months and went literately everyday. However i eventually left uni because she course i was doing wasnt ideal and although the first 3 months at uni were the best times in my life that time had long gone.

Which brings us to now almost, im back with my parents living the same shit, working a minimum wage job with shit hours so i earn nothing making it impossible to move out. And finally im living out my last effort choice thing to find some sort of meaning in life which was to join the army (which im currently going through the application process) in hopes that id get shot and die or something similar and then get my name on a plaque so that id atleast be remembered a little bit. I did meet a girl not long ago and almost got with her but again despite her being the one to approach me and continues to when she sees me she ignores me when i try to talk to her over facebook. And a month or so after i left uni i got the same empty feeling and then some that i felt back when i was rejected for the first time and i have felt that way ever since. Ive never smiled in my life but never used to struggle to fake one but now i dont even try and struggle to even to just pretend. Uni was supposed to be the last thing to fix my joke of a life but it was just another thing i was wrong about.

But there you have it a reddit post that is actually a novel written by me, starring me and produced by me. Heres hoping it ends soon despite the fact our army doesnt fight much anymore, but i guess trump is probably gonna start a war at some point and the one thing the UK likes to do is interfere with everything America does.

I've been pretty depressed for a while, on good meds and doing therapy and whatnot which helps. But my life is in such a goddamn rut and so are my emotions. I've been let down or tortured by any ""friendships"" I've had over my whole life, from early childhood to right now - my college years. I'm 20 years old in a wonderful major at a great school, and I study hard and get good grades. I'm proud of this because I've been recovering from rape and it's been a brutal uphill battle with depression being the hardest part. I was feeling okay for the past month or so, things seemed to be looking up, but now I'm totally spiraling. 

When I come home for the summer, I'm afraid of seeing so many people that I don't like (including rapists) that I'm afraid to leave the house. I constantly feel like nobody likes me, nobody wants to be around me because I am so negative and a downer, and I have so few friends at home to begin with (maybe like 2). I am afraid to ever admit I feel sad or upset because I honestly don't even fucking know why or how to explain it. I'm irritable a lot and just always feel like crying over the dumbest things. I feel like I am too sensitive for this world and it's crushing me, everyone is a disappointment and nobody ""gets"" me. Doesn't help that I'm about to go through a tough breakup because I can't stand my long term boyfriend anymore (promise that's not a depressed-decision, it's been a long time coming). 

I'm just overwhelmed and haven't felt this bad in so long. I would never try to kill myself and the thought of dying terrifies me, but it crosses my mind that I hate this world and I hate how I don't fit in here, if it weren't for how much I love my parents and 2 siblings I would wish I didn't exist. I don't have close or very reliable friends at home or at my college and I think about this all of the time. Maybe it's just stupid fake social media, but it seems like everyone else is always having so much fun/getting invited places/has people to lean on outside immediate family besides me. I'm just a freak. What about me is so fundamentally unlikeable that none of my friendships have lasted and most have ended up with me being hurt or bullied into oblivion? I try to be kind and empathetic but nobody really cares about me or thinks of me.

Sorry for the rant, just wonder if anyone feels the same. Or has advice. Do I just have to ""toughen up"" ? Become a ruthless bitch? I don't get it. What is wrong with me? People say, ""just be yourself!"" but i don't even know who I am anymore. So far being myself has gotten me screwed so many times. I'm so angry at the world.

409,1494128887,europeanoddball,I think I need help,"I've been feeling pretty down lately, but I haven't been exactly right for as long as I remember. Been trying to cope on my own, but I'm struggling and most of the time feel lost and confused. I just don't know what to do or think anymore.

Recently, I began feeling extremely demotivated and sad about my life - where I am and what I'm doing. Part of it might be justified, I'm objectively not very happy about my situation, but I'm also very much aware of how easy it is to confuse and misplace feelings so I try not to make any assumptions. I moved to the US almost 2 years ago to start my doctorate and currently am unsure whether I want to finish it. Part of me wants to finish it, but the other part knows I am here because at the time I started I simply had nowhere else to be. This is partly what makes it so difficult for me to stay motivated - I don't know whether I'm doing the right thing by forcing myself to continue or whether this just wasn't the right choice in the first place.

I've been feeling very lonely, but that isn't anything new to me, always been lonely or felt out of place. Lived apart from my parents for the most part of the last 7 years, am not particularly close to the rest of my family and haven't got any close friends left to speak of. Most people have only been my friends because at some point in their lives they needed me, and then simply moved on. Recently, it's gotten to the point that I just keep other people at a distance and view them as temporary acquaintances. And while this is keeping me sane, it's also making me more sad.

However, not everything is bad. Part of me still wants to keep fighting and after all my past dating pitfalls and misgivings, I met a girl I intend to marry and have a family with. I just don't know whether I'm doing the right thing here and now, whether I'm supposed to be this way before it somehow gets better and nothing I try seems to make any change. I don't want to feel alone and lost, but despite everything, that's exactly how I feel.

I tried talking to people, I tried counselling, getting it out of my system. Most people pretty much didn't care, counselling never helped and I seem to be reaching my limit of how much I can take before I get tired.

You guys ever had bad side effect before?","I suffer from depression, and I've been taking zoloft for a while now. I made the mistake of drinking alcohol and smoking weed while going 3 days without my medication. I ended up having a manic episode.

Honestly, I now have a better perspective of those who suffer from bipolar disorder, because holy shit that was a scary episode. 

I was super energized and beyond happy, everything in my life was perfect and how I wanted it to be. I went to the damn ocean by myself and got in even though its was about 30 degree waters. I walked around San Francisco with my phone completely dead and less than 5 dollars on me. I said YES! to anything and everything. Everything was just so much, so overwhelming, I couldn't do all the things I wanted but I still tried to do them, only to abandon it and move on to something else. 

Just wanted to post this before I go talk to my psych about it. Please don't ever use substances while on medication for depression. I found myself on a bridge tempted to jump over just because I wanted to know what the wind will feel like when falling off of it.

419,1494130249,bgumsmurphy,Under a lot of pressure and unsure what option to proceed with to best look after my mental health.,"Hi everyone. Just in a bit of a shit situation and I'd like some advice and perspective on it. Sorry for the longish read I go on a lot.

I am at the end of my second year of my university course, I am repeating second year this year after taking time out half-way through second year the first time around because of my depression. I have four 5000 word essays to write in just under three weeks, and two exams in the two weeks after the essays are all in. I have not started three of the essays and it normally takes me two to three weeks to complete one five thousand word essay. I may be able to do an exam instead of one of the essays, which would mean two essays to do in the next three weeks instead.

I have missed classes and work because of my depression this year and have not read nor do I even know the plots of most of the books that the exams will be on. I had been getting much more work in this time around than last year and was hopeful I could make it through the year but it is looking unlikely.

My department know about my circumstances and the deadline I am talking about for the essays is the final date any work can be handed in this year. I have already missed the original deadlines which I had extended but I am now starting to miss the extended deadlines as well. I believe they can waiver any deduction of marks for lateness because of my circumstances but there is a certain date after which I cannot hand in work. 

I can try and pull this off but I don’t know if I will manage. I think it is more likely than not that I will not manage. The other option is to repeat the year again, which I would find demotivating. I know I shouldn’t but I can’t help but feel ashamed by the prospect of repeating the year twice. All the people I started with are graduating this year and I feel like I’m just too inadequate to progress in life. I feel ashamed that I'm stuck here whilst everyone else is moving on.

What makes me particularly ashamed of being in this situation again is that my depression has been made worse by taking recreational drugs this year and the last time I ended up being faced with this decision. Most of my social circle take them, mostly with no ill effects, but I end up shut up in my room for a week after smoking weed for a few nights. I went on a week-long bender about the time I should have started working on these essays and have felt too depressed to get much done in the six weeks between then and now and well, here I am. 

I haven’t told the department about the drug use and I feel like a despicable fraud because of it. I have gone ten months without taking drugs and was still very much depressed so I don’t think they are the cause but they definitely make it much worse and I’m caught in a cycle of turning to them to escape from my mood for a short while and having that make it even worse in the long run.

I worry that even if I repeat the year again I will end up not managing like I have done for the past two. I have work experience in call centres, cafes, bars and a care home and I know I could make a bit of a living without a degree in these jobs but I don’t want a career in any of them and I worked really hard to get here, it’s a well-regarded university and the degree would definitely get me more satisfying work where I’d be treated better. I like the course when I’m working at it but I’ve never really been well or mature enough to engage with it as much as I should.

My friends at uni have just told me to do the work and that I can do it but my belief in that is starting to fall away, and I feel they will judge me as lazy or incompetent if I told them I was thinking of repeating the year again. 

I don’t know whether to try and get this work done, to repeat the year again or to drop out altogether. I just see all of them ending in personal failure. Any advice with this would be really appreciated.

420,1494130349,Immunittty,I have lost my motivation,"I've lost almost all my motivation in life but still keep going, which I hate. I'm only 17, but I've had therapists for extensive self hate since age 6. When I was young (7-8) I had to quit baseball because if I struck out I'd hit my head against a wall as punishment. Anyways, all my life I've had an eating disorder where I practically only eat unhealthy things. I'm mildly overweight (26.6 bmi) but exercise very often. I've never had a serious girlfriend, and constantly see girls I really like abandon me to go with other guys. I often hear girls wonder why I can't be like my brother, 20, who's far better than I in looks and social ability. I've lost the ability to talk to girls, avoiding conversation with them at this point. I have a constant sense that people only respond to me out of pity and don't like me. I view myself as a nuisance and bother. At this point I see myself as such a bother that I only talk to girls I like a maximum once a week unless for school related things. I take the blame for the majority of things that others do wrong, often being taking the consequences as well. I play varsity soccer, but I constantly tell myself I shouldn't be allowed on the team at all, as I can recall a few times where my defending (or lack thereof) has cost my team a game. I go to a very competitive school where I can't make new friends, girls are really hard to get, and the homework amounts to 4-5 hours a night. Essentially, I do school work almost every day for the whole day. I've lost the will or reason to go on, as I see no future in sight. My lack of social abilities and eating disorder has led me to believe that I can never be loved by a girl and don't deserve it if I see any sort of interest coming my way. I've had a few encounters where girls seemed interested, but I didn't let myself believe they ever would be, since they were out of my league entirely. Thanks for listening all, I just never get to say these things out loud. My parents get mad at me when I say I hate myself or any negative things about myself because they view that as an insult to them and God. Ultimately, I would never commit suicide, but I hate waking up every day of my life, having nothing to look forward to. ",/r/depression/comments/69ph29/i_have_lost_my_motivation/

422,1494131767,Napkins_pm,How are you surviving?,"I've been having such a fucking nightmare of a time for about ten years now. I didn't even realize how severely depressed I was until about a month ago. Like, I *knew*, but it didn't click internally. When I started pushing past my debilitating anxiety, I realized it wasn't even that hard. What I thought was my most important issue was just a simple pebble wall blown over by minimal effort.

I'm so depressed. I loathe that word and I always have. I just can't stop seeing the realization stare me in the face at every moment. I've been fighting battles for years without even understanding who my enemy was.

I don't give a shit about anything. I haven't for such a long time. Now that I'm trying to push past fears (anxiety) and honestly look at myself--- what little of this husk of a person--- I'm learning that I don't care about anyone who is suppose to be close to me. My family who has supported me through all this, no less. It's not for lack of trying. I want so badly to feel something that I've been taking it for years, albeit badly.

####How are you guys surviving?
I just don't understand how you can live years looking these morally insidious truths in the face. What has helped you cope? 

I'm college aged and I can't even deal with my *day to day* care. Not because I physically can't or laziness, but I don't see the point in doing it.

I'm not motivated to do school work, exercise, or even talk to anyone. When I walk down the hallways by myself I see everyone around me talking to each other and I don't know why I can't be more like everyone else. I used to be chatty in elementary school. Had a nice group of friends in middle school, but they've all kind of grown away from me. I'm just so lonely, I could go a whole school day with practically no one even acknowledging my existence.

I browse Reddit or do some other dumb shit, then my parents tell me to stop and do my homework and I tell them I will but then I keep procrastinating. The cycle repeats and repeats. I get so anxious over my work that I try to forgot it exists, then I get sad because I can never do my work. I play games on my phone to waste time but I always end up feeling like an idiot because instead of hanging out with people or doing basically anything productive, I'm sitting at home on my ass, alone and unmotivated. I get occasional bursts of happiness, but then I remember just how insignificant I am to everyone around me. My parents really, really love me, but I don't feel like I can tell them what's going on. I see all the motivational quotes that say stuff like ""be yourself and people will like you"" or ""just go out there and meet people.""

440,1494135712,hjklg,"I feel so alone, and pathetic because of it","This is something that has bothered me for a long time; like, as long as I can remember. I'm a young adult male. I am generally pretty quiet. Making friends is difficult for me, because people make me nervous. 

Now, I'm not a frail, short person. I'm a 6ft guy who is at a normal weight. I'm fairly handsome, smart, and ..well endowed. 

I only say those things, especially the last bit, not to brag, but to help paint a picture. I'm not lacking the confidence to consider myself somewhat desirable. I'm saying this because I want to cover the speculation of ""well maybe he's just ugly, or weird, or dumb, or annoying"". Maybe I am annoying or weird, but I don't think I would be able to keep some of the relationships I've had for such long periods if I was a truly unlikable person.

Getting to the point, I have always struggled with wanting a friend that would have me around often. Most friends I have are at a distance. They aren't the kind of friends that say ""Hey I got some stupid shit to do, come with me"", knowing that I'll come along because it doesn't matter *what* they're doing.

I've never had that with anyone, besides a girl, and that has always ended. I feel so alone right now. As long as I've been going to my university, I have not made a friend that I felt really wanted me. My case in point being, nobody contacts me first. I can count on my hands the amount of times I have been asked, without prompt, to be included in the activity. I can distinctly remember the events.

Yesterday was graduation, and two of my classmates were struggling to get an assignment turned in before our final hard deadline the night before. I helped to get it done, and because of this, they were able to graduate. 

They were extremely grateful, and they even picked me up and we rode to graduation together. All during the night prior, and during the ceremony, we talked about hitting the bars later on. After the ceremony we parted to see our families for the day, but still with the intention of going out later. I never got that call. I never heard anything. 

I don't do people favors with the expectation of a return. I don't feel like somebody owes me something, because generally, most of my favors cost me nothing besides time; time I would probably be wasting anyway. 

Today was supposed to be the one day that I got to feel proud of myself, and I stayed home alone and drank whiskey. I missed out meeting other grads celebrating at the bar. I missed out seeing acquaintances, who consider themselves my friend, and being congratulated. I don't really care about being praised, but I just felt like this would be one day I could be happy with myself.

I've heard the same thing every time I'm upset about this. ""You should get in touch with them first."" No. I refuse to invite myself places like that. I've done it before and it always feels like I'm only included because I reminded them I exist, or they couldn't think of a good enough excuse to say no. I want to feel wanted, and I haven't felt that in the longest time.

And because this is a problem with me, not only me but certainly *somehow* my fault, I don't want to do this anymore. I don't enjoy being alive. I haven't for the longest time. It's exactly the opposite. All I can think about is how, ""This is life, this is all there is and all there will ever be."" I am nobody and nobody wants me besides the people that are obliged to care because of circumstances we were born into. There is nothing good down the road, just more unhappiness and feeling useless to help anyone. Just more feeling like even if I think I'm doing everything right, I could end up hurting someone, which would be worse than never doing anything at all. I can only avoid leaving some kind of stain on the world by ceasing to live, or refusing to leave the house. I just don't see the point in all of this. I haven't for a while, and I guess maybe if somebody cared enough to ask me if I wanted to come along, or text me to say ""congratulations, I know how difficult school has been for you"", just.. anything. The only reason I don't is because my parents would be devastated. 

tl;dr  I have no friends. I hate living. I wish I would die, I really honestly mean that. Nobody loves me that isn't obligated to by birth. ",/r/depression/comments/69pss9/i_feel_so_alone_and_pathetic_because_of_it/
441,1494135779,DessertWitch,Love isn't making me feel better,"Ever since my ex and I broke up, I thought moving on from her would make me feel better. I dedicated so much time and effort to trying to find somebody and I ended up finding two people who like me, one person who likes me a LOT, and one of my exes from years ago, who still loves me. I've never had so much affection shown to me. I should be on top of the world, but I'm still in the same slump.

All I can ever think about is how that break-up really fucked me up. I'm hanging out with all of these incredible people who like me way more than I like them, and the entire time I'm just afraid that I'll never love again. But I'm keeping up this charade with all of them, plus with everybody else I know to give the illusion that not only am I doing fine, but I'm doing better than my ex. I'm tired of lying. I'm miserable, but I don't want to admit it because I don't want to lose all of this attention.

442,1494136064,exman1992,Suggestions sought.,"I've been feeling a bit off today. It would have been the second anniversary of my ex and I. While I realize that it's for the best we broke up, I'm still a little sad about missing what we used to have, and feeling a little lonely/sad.  I've tried my usual coping skills, tried journaling, tried cooking and cleaning the apartment. The feeling is still there.  Any of you guys have any tips or ideas?

Some background: girlfriend and I had dated for about two years and had been living together. She went to go on an internship an hour and a half away, we still were able to visit and whatnot, when all of a sudden (to me) she says she doesn't want to be in a committed relationship anymore. She also said that my not being able to sleep, eat, or leave bed for a week or so hardly was ""bullshit"", ""senioritis"" (graduate with two BA's in a week, woo!), and that she was tired of me expecting her to pick up the fallout of not doing well (this after I went to her with this after she got into me for not communicating well enough to her liking -- and she's dealt with depression, too. So that really hurt). So I'm on the one hand very much able to recognize red flags and where I am better off being with someone supportive or not at all, but still miss the good times, I guess?  I've journaled about it some. But like I said, still feel off/sad. ",/r/depression/comments/69ptg5/suggestions_sought/

I now have been bumped down to the bottom of the waiting list. 

I have been struggling to maintain employment due to depression, anxiety, and a lack of support system with my children. I have tried to do everything right. Despite being a single mother suffering in silence from chronic mental illness, I managed to become a part of an honor society for maintaining a decent GPA, and I even started to trust people again and build a social life. 

However, I feel like my life is at a standstill. I am back to not trusting people and feeling like there is no way out. I feel embarrassed because my life has not changed one bit, and I'm sick of relying on welfare to get by thinking that it is ""just a stepping stone"" only to be knocked right back on my ass where I started.

The subjects aren't difficult at all, and I usually greatly enjoy writing and am pretty good at it. I would keep forgetting due dates for some reason. Whenever I open a new word document to start writing, I'm overcome with this feeling of numbness and hopelessness, and I just stop and switch to doing something else (read: wasting time). I take antidepressants (I've tried all kinds of them) and Adderall (prescribed), both of which help me not feel sad, but I still feel numb and completely without energy. 

My parents were frustrated with me already, when I was in a different major last year and failed the same courses two semesters in a row. I thought it was because I was in the wrong major, so I switched to something I actually liked. The first semester I switched I actually got all A's and B's. 

Now my parents might make me stop attending university and live at home, which would be fucking awful because being at home feels like being in prison for me, but I haven't told them about this stuff yet so I don't actually know how they'd respond (and I'll be honest, I don't know how to tell them).

**Unto You**

I am a hollow husk—de-rooted   
How many times do I—  
How many times do I—


Have to tell you that:  
My sister is in prison.   
You broke my heart.   
I was cut open—again   


You don’t care about me.   
Not Angela. Not me.  
You are trying to mold me into—You  
Into a person that always agrees,   
that always takes the brunt of everything  
That never has emotions. 

All I ever wanted  
Needed—  
Got--  
Every single time  
Lest I forget   
Abuse me—tear me into   
The shape of your mishappen eye  
Under the guise of Enochian   

I am the ritual.  
I am the sacrifice.   

I am nothing but a means to an end that only you can see.  
I am blindfoldedeightofswords—swallow this and feel 

Better, Bitch. 

**Hope Chest**

How can you sleep?   
How can you lie there   
And breathe—  
When I can’t?     

I swear to God   
All of the pastures  
I have dreamt of   

All of the twisted—gnarled   
Elevators, one-inch needles—IN  
My hip does pain mean absolutely  
Nothing to you?  

I can see her body   
Being crushed by   
The hot steel wheels  
Of a train, ripping—Through  
Her torso,  
Her arm flapping shooting  
Out from under the tracks into the desert. 

She is dead when her face scrapes against steel  
and rocks, and dirt. 

I take pills and float. I watch her   
Over and over, and all you can talk   
About is money—and how everything  
Isn’t about me.   

Isn’t about me.   

Dead.Dead.Dead.Dead  
Nevercomingbackdead.
  
Her head is rotting on a library table 
  
The shelves are so tall they start to touch,  
I dreamt Dylann Roof raped me    

But I can’t tell you about that, can I?  
Because you just think that I want dick, right?  

Freudian concepts are the only ones you can  
seem to grasp because they are self-reliant on   
The very human condition that brought us here  
In the first fucking place. 

I didn’t have to wait for the train, love.  
It was you.

461,1494140166,kale-um,A Bitter Rant That Didn't Go Very Far,"Sorry to waste your time. This is likely going to become very vitriolic and possibly come across as self-absorbed. I also discuss depression, gloss over an eating disorder, and suicide. Don't know if this is really asking for advice or just ranting, that's mostly up to you.
 
Sorry.

I'm what you'd call the ""toxic"" friend, as US media likes to call it today. Negative events consume my every thought, I have a difficult time keeping composure under stress (though being an actor helps with faking it), and am overly open with my emotions whilst simultaneously reclusive.

TLDR, depression is a pain, as you probably know.

Over the course of events over the past two years, I've found myself in a current friendship circle between three primary pegs.
One (1) is a truly fantastic person; empathetic, funny, understanding and receptive of problems. Able to make almost anyone feel better about themselves regardless of circumstances.

Another (2) is kind of like me, but in a tougher situation and equally depressed.

The final (3) is also similar to myself without as outspoken of depressive tendencies.

It's been kind of a wild situation running around this group, but nonetheless over the entirety of the time knowing them, I've been a third wheel. 1 and 3 dated for quite some time, and 2 and 3 were best friends. Then a bitter, horrible breakup occurred and they don't speak to each other whenever it can be avoided. By proxy, 2 has also separated from 3.

In between the months before and during the breakup, I had been completely consumed by my eating disorder (no pun intended) and cut myself off from EVERYONE. No social medias, no friends, nothing except my mind and I.

That probably is why the relationship now between myself and them is so inconsistent. I wasn't there in the heaviest moment and am now in a permanent state of catch up with the friendship.

2 and 3 have been dating for quite a while now and are very, VERY on each other... literally. It's PDA, but worse, and 24/7. It was like this with the previous relationship, though, so it shouldn't be all that surprising in retrospect.

The primary issue (which I've stalled from speaking on, sorry) is that I am essentially emotionally-dependent on 1. They're a rock that kind of keep this boat afloat at the moment. While I still consistently actively consider... making an irreversible choice, they've managed to be the glue that keeps me down to earth.

Right now, we're nearing the final stages of a group project that began when 1 and 3 were still dating. Which means that the group is innately broken and difficult to have collaboration because two of the group members outright avoid confrontation with one another. The project, which required experimentation, never got it's experiments STARTED, let alone finished, and we've already turned in a closing paper. There's a presentation that accounts for half of the overall grade in a few days, which we have almost nothing to show for.

Trying to be everyone's friend is excruciating, as much as I want it to work. I can tell that the relationship I have with 1 isn't healthy, as they've inadvertently become not much more than a shoulder to cry on, which was never the original intent. Ultimately I just want to be useful for them, so long as I'm still around in this life. But they insist that they want to help combat my suicidal thoughts, which I inherently don't want. It's gotten so far where it's almost argument-like in nature, and it occurs in nearly every conversation we have now. We don't have casual banter the way that normal friends do. Everything is cold, separated. We sound like total strangers to each other and we are. I value them more than most other things right now, because it's one of the only signs of hope that really exist anymore. But the fact of the matter is that I'm really not that relevant to them, and I know it. It doesn't matter a single bit how much they say that I'm important, because really I could entirely disappear from their life and there wouldn't really be a single difference. There are times when I'm around them where if I didn't say a single word, nothing would really happen.

It sucks even more that even with the efforts put into making their lives better as repentance for my continued existence, it doesn't seem like I'm relevant enough to be considered an adequate resource for help. It sounds so self-centered to say, but it still hurts being turned away when 1 or 2 is having an emotional issue. It borders offensive, and I wish I could say I understand and just leave it at that without a second thought, but it's frustrating and demeaning. But maybe it's just a stupid thought. I'm sorry.

There's more to say, but too much has been said as it is, I'm sorry.
TLDR, third wheeling sucks, especially when you're depressed and emotionally dependent on one person in the relationship. Also, when one of your best friends is their ex.

I feel exhausted. Numb. Blank. I want to cry and I can feel the lump in my throat but it won't come out. Home isn't a good place to be right now. 

It's my birthday tomorrow. I've never liked my birthday. Family forgot half the time. On the times they did remember, they went out of their way to make sure I knew I wasn't special and the day wasn't about me. I've been dumped twice on my birthday when I was a teenager and mugged once. It's always been a shit, terrible time and given the choice I've always chosen to ignore it. 

People talk about how it's supposed to be a celebration and appreciation of who you are. I feel awkward as hell whenever anyone compliments me, so the idea of that happening is scary. Plus I don't want to be disappointed again. 

My partner has spent the past few months talking about how she wants to make a big deal out of it and make up for all the terrible times I've had in the past. I initially told her I didn't want to do anything but as she kept pressing, I said ok.

I started to get my hopes up about it being good and I found out today that she's forgotten and has made plans to go hang out with friends instead.

Some info about me. Im 16, and my whole life has changed in the span of a year and a lot of good has come from it but there is some shit keeping me from enjoying it. I'm going to start with the story at the beginning of high school. I'm coming into high school, weighing 309 pounds, doing nothing but playing video games and making jokes with friends (the simple times). I knew that I was fat, but at the time I had accepted that. I thought “Well that's just who i'm going to be”. And i was happy with that. I never felt like my weight held me back. (Footnote: I hadn't liked a girl since the beginning of Middle school, I was over girls and i thought i would be for the length of my school career.) So that year had happened and left. I had a friend that was super popular. Long story short, he introduced me to his friends and i got accepted into his group. The summer that preceded this event was and will forever be the changing point in my life. It's all because of July 17th. So much happened that day. I found my love for coffee, New-Age Folk music and (The “G” word) Girls. I live near a water park. All my friends were going so I decided to go. I saw this girl, and my heart stopped. I had met her before but I never thought about girls until that moment. I don't know if it’s right for me to think that she is the love of my life but fuck me. I'm a year into it and i'm running on empty trying to find things wrong with her. Me and her talked the whole day, Snapped the whole night after we got to our houses. We fell asleep and life continued. I knew that I had to change. That next day I started losing weight for her. Everything I do, Up to now is to better myself for her. But back to the story. She went off the grid… Stop all communications with everyone. This killed me, the one person I wanted to talk too, Wouldn’t give me the light of day. I've never legitimately thought about suicide except for once, And it was that day. I thought that day was just foreshadowing for the rest of my fucking life. I was ready to end it, but i'm here aren't I. I continued with summer and it ended, all while i'm still in love with this girl. But if you have never experienced love, I can tell you something. Even if you love someone with all your heart, you will learn to accept the fact that yall wont be together, And i have. Because of her, I learned guitar (something i've always wanted to do) for an emotional outlet, I lost 65 pounds, I stopped playing games. .I'm a better man now because of her. Thats all im getting into for tonight but there is so much more. I've been depressed for about 3 months now and i'm just looking for someone I can talk to that I don't know.

I'm 17 in my last semester of junior year in highschool and I'm fucking failing this whole year. I'm so depressed I spend most of my time sleeping my life away. My teachers have given me countless chances to bump my grades up but I don't care enough or don't have the motivation to do any homework. I feel like I'm letting everyone down around me because they just want to see me succeed. I'm almost a man in the eyes of the law and I'm paralyzed with fear because of it. The worst part is that I have a good life compared to a lot of people and I feel so dumb for feeling the way I do. My parents have fought my entire life and I think that may be a factor of my sadness. I just feel so empty all the time and I don't understand why. I've been depressed since I was 11 and it's only gotten worse as the years have gone by. My doc put me on Zoloft and it works so well for my anxiety that I have forgotten that it exists but I'm up to 100mg and it does almost nothing for my depression. I recently took a vacation to Hawaii and it was the first time I was truly happy in a couple years. But right when I got home I felt all of the weight dump back on me. My brain feels so foggy all the time and it's really hard to think. I've never been suicidal but lately I've been feeling like I want to die. I dated this girl for about 9 months and I felt like I had a purpose and like I was needed and it made me feel happy. I've been trying to chase that feeling ever since we broke up and every relationship that I try to get into I either get scared off or I get very close to dating and she calls it off. I'm very good friends with my ex as we text every day but I get to hear about all of her boy troubles and I get really fucking sad and jealous because I  want her back but it's never going to happen. I really love her as a person and I just want her to be happy but I can't help my feelings. I just don't know what to do anymore. I've been to therapy many times and that doesn't seem to help. I feel like if my mental state gets any worse I'm going to make a rash decision and hurt myself. I'm terrified. I really enjoy art and drawing but I can't even bring myself to do that in my free time. I'm just so tired all the time.

I've been a happy person most of my life. I am very conscientious and i know what i like and what i don't like. I am currently doing a postgraduate degree, which i definitely do enjoy. However i know that my abilities in getting a job in this field is limited. Maybe coupled with my lost of motivation every now and then, i find it even harder to build up my skills. Throughout the past years, now that i think of it, i occasionally have these depressive episodes, not major, but just days where i feel like i'm in such a dark space, future is bleak, and i am just worthless. I didn't think i was depressed then, Just thought it might be hormones. I usually talk to friends or play some game and i'll be ALLG. 

Recently i was broken up by. It was a surprise to me as despite things were going a bit sour, i thought it was my problem and i was trying to work through it. So i think the breakup pushed me over the edge a little bit, and on the day i cried and definitely lost all my motivation. I talked to a DR who referred me to a psychologist (yet to see anyone) as i have lost all motivation in doing anything related to uni and life. 

Since the broke up i started using a dating app, i guess just to feel confident about myself again. Started talking to this guy who i enjoy chatting with, he wasn't into anything serious, and i think i'm not in a good position to start a relationship also. But i find myself very easily cling onto this 'friendship' and wanted more from it. Which is stupid. LoL

Fast forward to today. Woke up in a slump, couldn't concentrate the whole day. Tried to talk to my friends but they were busy. Feel like I'm worthless. Can't get anything in life, men, friends, degree. I want to graduate. I want to be confident and have people loving me the way i love people. 

I already know my game plan. Psychologist, study, friends, and after all this and once i have my life together. Then i'll truly appreciate myself. Thank you for reading.. ",/r/depression/comments/69q77a/so_this_is_what_it_feels_like/

476,1494143723,Total900,Really feeling lost day by day.,"I'm 17 in highschool. I was homeschooled until I was 13, my entire childhood I had zero friends or social interactions and all I craved was some friends to go on adventures with. I had my first real social interactions when I joined a homeschool group at 13 were I made 1 or 2 good friends and developed some hobbies like bmx and I still was super lonely. I went to the highschool this year for the first time which was a huge social shock, I had to learn all the unspoken social rules so I'm still very quiet and anxious. I used to be UNBELIEVABLY self conscience about my looks but when I went to the highschool that anxiaty switched from my appearance (I learned I wasnt that ugly) to my mental. Where nowadays I freak out about any small social interactions with a girl or anyone really and I'm just so in my head all the time my social anxiaty doesn't let me express myself like I would like to. I'm still craving a group of peers and I know I have the potential to be very popular and outgoing but I'm so anxious about my words I never can do anything.
I smoke weed every single day and the little friends I do have are friendly stoners so that helps.
To make matters worse my parents or orthodox Christian.
They have a very strong ""us vs the world"" mentality where they think everything outside of their religion is demonic. 
They always tell me that I am turning my soul over to the dark side and how I need to become religious and be obedient to them or else I'll live a life of sadness. 
They dont like any of my friends and I've had to lead a bit of a double life because the only kids theyd like me to be friends with would be other religious nerds.
I lie to them all the time because I have to.
They are so sad that I've changed in the past few years towards the ""demonic"" side that I know my mom cries at night because she worries about me.
I love them a ton but I can't help that I'm not religious and my ENTIRE life so far, from values, to music, to goals and ambition revolves around a different mindset and lifestyle then them. 
So thats whats on my mind. I'm sorry if this makes zero sense I found it super hard to describe my situation and I just wanted to get it off my chest.
Does anyone else deal with religious parents? social anxiaty, no sense of purpose when I know I should be doing greater things. 
idk.
sorry for the extremely messy post. ",/r/depression/comments/69q7j3/really_feeling_lost_day_by_day/

484,1494146983,ion1444,I feel stuck,"Ramblings ahead, be warned.

Finals are coming up. I'm not going back to school next semester, though. I'm not suited for it, I've had too many meltdowns to count in just the past 2 months.

I need to find a better job. $10 an hour isn't enough to survive off of, let alone allow me to do what I want to do in life, which is to get out of my state, find some place far from society and all its noise, and be free to do as I please.

My romantic life is on hold. I've become untrusting since my emotionally abusive relationships, and no one seems to fit who I want and need, which is incredibly unrealistic. I doubt that I'll ever really be happy in any relationship.

Nothing feels right. The only time I feel right is when I've got the grass beneath my feet with only the sounds of birds singing around me. Some sort of insatiable wanderlust, I suppose.

I feel hopeless, completely and utterly. I feel so beaten down and worthless. I feel like I don't belong wherever I go. The only place I am even able to find some sort of peace is when I'm completely alone, and even then I feel... wrong. It's hard to describe.

A constant struggle for me is working out what I want to do in my free time.  I have a family so some stuff is structured but when we have a clear day my instinctive reaction is to sit at home and read and do very little.  If someone asked me what I wanted to do I'd probably say that I wanted to do that but at the same time I know it's not always the best for me so I guess I want to want to do other things.

I sometimes make myself go out and do things but it's not always what I want.

That's my first post on this sub, so I don't really know what to expect, but thanks to anyone who'd stop by to read this.

To make it short: I lie all the time. I can't help it, that's part of me. My life's pretty boring, I don't really have a passion, and I'm ashamed to admit it. I'm afraid of loneliness, so I feel like if I tell my friends about how I really feel, they'll just get bored and leave me by myself. 

I've been lying for so long I've started to convince myself of some shits. I convinced myself that I was bisexual to give me some sort of social status. I went so deep in the lies it seems I have two separate life, between my family and my group of friends.

I'm not doing it for fun, at least I don't think so, I just don't want to be alone. I can't even rely on my emotions anymore. I don't know if I'm actually depressed by the fact that I can never be myself or if I'm just writing this message to get some attention. I don't understand myself anymore. 

Though I want to change, I really do. I hate the person I became, and it hurts so much. The feeling that I can't even rely on myself for the most simple things, it's just so hard. I don't know anymore wether I'm myself or the other me. I don't know if I'm mad, or just a dickhead. Does anybody know what I could do?

My life externally seems pretty great, I just had an interview for a promotion, I eat relatively healthy, I'm starting to read again, drinking and smoking less. Been exercising for a few months now. I have a decent number of friends doing more and more social things. Women situation is ok, single now but moderately attractive and thin. Have 2 or 3 good solid hobbies 

Problem is I just don't want to do anything - haven't since age 17 (26 now). No work, no hobbies, no talking to people, not truly interested in doing anything. Just wish some asshole would come shoot me in the dome so I could be done with life. Obviously this seems like depression since it's been almost 10 years of this.

What do I do? Is it truly a mental issue that can be rectified by medication? Seems much deeper than that if you know what i mean. I feel like I'm living my life so my parents wont be devastated if I were gone.

anyone who's reading this, I just want to let a little out with this. No attention/bullied as a child so now i'm a needy whining little shit etc.. 

I just feel so alone in this world, I've never really had a best friend, I don't have someone I can talk to daily, one of my flatmates is pretty alright but there's limits to what i can disclose to him. I'm currently going through exams so I'm under a shit ton of stress but it's putting things into perspective that I don't really have any friends. My group of friends who I would hang out with in class and stuff just seem to be ignoring me it's sooo... I dunno sad?

I fucking hate how I am right now, I need constant acknowledgement that I exist, for someone so alone I just need someone, something. Anyone who i've ever got close to I either want to love them or just don't let them in, I don't know how to function like normal people and it's hard to put into words...

I pretty much only get through each day because of music and knowing that I need these grades, I don't have a plan in life but university needs to be done to at least a first class for me to even feel some sort of success. I'm far from perfection but expect nothing but that from myself, I find it easier to set unattainable goals and work towards them then setting something reasonable and being happy. I don't know if i'll ever be content.

There isn't really a question to this, more of just me doing what I occasionally need to do which is just putting how I feel into words. 

I hate talking about myself but if anyone wants to have someone ask how their day has been and such feel free to DM me. I love life and everyone and everything about me but I still feel numb and so distant. As much as I hate life and myself, others deserve happiness and If I can make you happy maybe i'll feel better.

Before that I took Venlafaxin and also got off it with the help of Elontril. I also took antipsychotics for some time, which helped me sleep but had many side effects. I was never able to keep a stable sleeping pattern since puberty. I'm always wandering around the clock.

Every time I stopped taking my antidepressants, after I talked with my doctor, I ended up getting a sudden boost in energy and focus. It suddenly was easier for me to bring myself to lift weights and get my life in order. This effect lasted each time for 2-3 months and then suddenly stopped.

I have no idea why this is happening, but I'd love to keep these positive effects, if possible.

I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety and a possible personality disorder(AvPD/ Schizoid). Often people also tell me that I seem like I'd have some form of autism, but it's not enough to really diagnose it. I'm telling you this, because I always had the feeling that I struggle with ADHD. I was never really able to keep order in my life and I always feel like my mind is stuck in some kind of mental fog.

I wasn't able to get any medication for it, because my PE and psychiatrist just didn't want to explore the possibility with me. They thought that I should focus on getting a job and overcome my negative thought patterns, both seemed overwhelmed with my situation and I felt like I was too much of a problem for them.

Over the last weeks I've tried to survive on caffeine tablets, but they seem to have less and less of an effect.

I'm now stuck somewhere between a returning depression, anxiety and zero motivation. I'm not sure anymore what I should do. It's nearly impossible for me to develop and act on any plan of action.

I want to ask my doctor for an ADHD medication, but he'll probably just think that I want to abuse it, or that it will make my anxiety worse. It's really hard to get diagnosed here in Germany, especially as an adult.",/r/depression/comments/69qmrw/sudden_burst_of_motivation_and_focus_after/

Sexual side-effects are also common with SSRIs, such as loss of sexual drive, failure to reach orgasm, and erectile dysfunction. Although usually reversible, these sexual side-effects can, in some cases, last for months or years after the drug has been completely withdrawn.

My sister and I am closer than most siblings and I was having a really rough day. But I guess texting her boyfriend about silly things is more important than talking to you sister sitting next to you.

_________________________________________

_____________________________


I don’t know how to write this because I am too boggled up in my head right now and I don’t have the right words to say this but basically … I am becoming more and convinced that I wasted 10 years of my life. I wanted to avoid it because I do not want to think that it is too late for me but I was avoiding the truth. I am not in a very good state and I do not see a good or decent future ahead of me.  10 years is a long time and I have been avoiding that mistake for a while but now, I cannot run away anymore. I cannot avoid taking responsibility for such a big mistake.

I fucked up my life. I fucked up my upbringing. I fucked up my future and most importantly, I fucked up my mind.

________________________________


So why do you think I think that I wasted my life? Well, I’ll tell you a bit about myself:

It started when I was around age 12. I was bullied. A lot. I was scapegoated, belittled, abused and berated over and over again because, at that time, boys wanted to show off that they are becoming men. So they found their prey and used me as a punching bag for their inner frustrations and inner hormonal spikes. I did not know what to do at that time. I was young and stupid. I was angry but I could not do much. I tried to fight me but I was beaten twice as hard. 

And you ask, why didn’t the teachers or the parents try anything?

Well, they did … sorta. Most of the time, I was the blame because they figured that I must be doing something to provoke other students to bully me so I was mostly shunned by some teachers and I still remember the look on their faces. As if when they saw me, I looked at me that I am nothing but trouble. *(looking back, I am not sure if that is true or not because I repressed most of it but maybe they were right. When you are bullied for so long, sooner or later, you become to identify yourself to the kind of person you are treated as, which was a dangerous time to be a teenager because you are still learning more about yourself based on how you interact with others and how others treat you. So I acted I unconsciously and undeliberately acted like the idiot that I was treated as. Either because I slowly identified myself that as time went on or because either I acted like that or I got an ass-whooping)*

Sometimes they had strict no tolerance policy. Didn’t matter who started what, both the bully and the victim got the punishment.

And sometimes, teachers did nothing at all because there is little that one can do. You cannot control teenagers sometimes because of their egocentricity and doing it the wrong way *(say, abusing your power or intimidating them)*, they would have been risking losing their job.

It affected how I saw myself. How I acted, how I thought, how I felt. It affected my grades and it affected how I viewed life. 

I could have made friends when I was a teenager and even after I finished secondary school when the bullies went their own paths but I already identified myself as the inferior one and found it very difficult to make friends. Either because I acted funny because  I lacked social skills or because I identified myself as the pathetic piece of shit that I still myself as or because I became a recluse and avoid interacting with other people. *(and where I live, word travels very fast and everyone knows everyone which gives you a big disadvantage)*

And I stayed that way for years. When I could have gone out and explored the world. Could have made memories and made friends. I could have improved my grades and my education *(something that I prioritized ever since I was young)* but I didn’t. I spent my days internalizing whatever bullshit my mind made me believe because I was slowly and slowly succumbing to a deep depression. I was slowly going deeper and deeper into that cave for years that it had become a part of my life. Try to imagine 10 whole years and every day, thousands of thoughts pass through your mind and you believe every single one of them and go deeper into that hole without questioning what you are doing. It is like stabbing yourself without even knowing why you are doing it.

________________________________

Anyway … when I was 16 when I finished secondary school, I thought that I could do something new. Change my life, make things better …. But I fucked that up too.

I developed an eating disorder that lasted for three years *(even today I sometimes have those temptations. Thinking about food and fat and control and so on)*. It was a short time in comparison to other people because I know that it can last for decades even but during those three years, it was hell for me. I felt like I made myself a slave of my own mind. I was not able to think straight. I made myself into a fucking monster. A weakling. A coward. I was underweight and angry and emotional and fucking scared. 

And the eating disorder does not affect just you, it affects the people around you … who did not take it lightly.

I have an overprotective mother. She is the alpha and she is not always the sane one either. She always had issues of her own. She can be loud and abusive and emotionally manipulative when things do not go her way *(she did not have a nice past either. Well, not exactly. She comes from a background where she internalized the idea that because she is a female, she is inferior and incapable. It affected her how she sees herself and her frustrations projects them to others)*

And guess what … she cannot tolerate her frustrations and projected them to me. 

I was abused for years and I was too scared to do anything. I tried to fight back but I cannot do much in the process. I had nowhere to go, I had no friends to back me up, other family members always followed her *(again, she is the alpha, plus siblings looked down on me because, during the eating disorder, it affected them as well)* and some people cannot understand that even females can be abusive. So I internalized everything. I became a coward. I cannot do anything but take in every bullshit she and whatever people said to me. I tried to fight back but I went into a stage of learned helplessness. And made was also bait for my mind. As days passed, my mind did not stop bullying me either. Calling me things, telling me what to think or not to think.

To this day, I am still experiencing these things. From the minute I wake up, the first thing that pops up in my head is to berate myself as much as possible **”Fuck you, you piece of shit. Look at you, you are a disgrace!”**. I tried suicide but the stubbornness of my self-preservation wouldn't allow me to do it which makes me feel even more of a coward and a pussy for not doing it.

For years, I was angry. Very, very, very angry. I tried to find ways to deal with it. I tried going to the gym but I was so obsessed with it because for one, it also reinforced the mentality of my eating disorder *(during that time, the mentality was still there, especially with a weak mentality)* and I was so angry, that the gym made me even angrier. So I felt that I cannot live without it and I wasn’t able to think clearly when I was trying to study, and I started to prioritise that instead of on my studies *(which to this day, I am ashamed of doing it because I had bad grades. I always had the mentality of high expectations because I wanted to do so well in my studies but I looked down on myself and it became a self-fulfilling prophecy and the grades said so. Plus, I did not have the best of teachers either. Some were really into their subjects but their teaching methods were not always that great. High egos, bad attitudes, grades equal intelligence, that kind of shit. It affected how I viewed myself as a student. Oh, and by the way, I was also finding it hard to study because I identified myself as the nerd. To this day I sometimes find it hard because I was bullied because of it too. That stereotypical alien nerdy guy. Overweight, ugly and unlikeable. Heck, when I see Big Bang Theory, I get angry and want to avoid it and I remember my sister telling me to man up. I know that one day I have to “deal with it” so to speak, but … I heard that phrase “Man up” over and over again, I started to resent it because I don’t believe that I am a man)*. And it is all my fault anyway. I made myself succumb to that eating disorder and I fucked up the family and I made my mother become a monster and she abused me. If I never was so weak, this would have never happened and maybe my family would be more happy.

________________________________

I am at university right now. I believe that I was lucky that I managed to get here. Very lucky. I still remember the expression on my mother’s face when I got in “You could have done better” and I believe that. I may not have been at the right state psychologically speaking but I could have done better *(again, high expectations. And also, my mother always pressured me to do well in school. Her mentality was understandable because she wanted to do well and have a decent job but her execution was … not very nurturing. Fear tactics, making comparisons with others, authoritarian type of parenting, that kind of stuff. I don’t know why she pressured me so much to do well in school. Maybe she saw the nerd in me or maybe she actually cares deep down but in the end, it was not a very effective parenting method. I could have stood up to my parents but I was intimidated to that I would be sent to the mental hospital, which is a stigma here or the police. There is little protection to their children of the parents by law and based on how I see it, plenty of people fall for the crying, helpless mother.)*

During those first few years, I did not go well. I prioritized my studies more and more but … my mind wouldn’t allow it. After years and years of telling me what to do, it had me by all of its strings. It keeps telling me what to think or not to think.

If I am thinking that I want to wear a red shirt but my mind tells me to wear the blue one instead, no matter how much I try to fight it, no matter how much I try to resist it, I eventually obey it and wear the blue shirt. And this happens all the time. If people have their own coping mechanisms to defend themselves from unpleasant thoughts and feelings, you can say that I don’t have any. If there is a thought that crosses my mind, say I am a weak person, you can bet your ass that that thought will stick and it is going to be very hard for me to remove it.

For 10 years, my mind managed to get a lot of experience on how to dictate my every move, thought, feeling and behavior. For 10 years I let it grow inside my head, like a cancer that continued to grow and made it very hard to remove or a neuro-degenerative disorder that slowly and slowly became a part of me and made it more difficult to remove because I came too attached it and became a part of me holistically.

I bowed down to my bullies. I bowed down to my parents and I am bowing down to my mind. 
I am not sure how much I can express how embarrassing and shameful that is.

I know that all of us have to fight against our own heads, after all, it can have a mind of its own sometimes. But from my point of view, it is like I am fighting against some sort of evil spirit that is inside my body and slowly trying to take control till it eventually makes me its prisoner.

I cannot express the burden that I feel that I have to be fully aware of its presence 24/7 and lowering my guard down once, it is like I allowed the enemy to enter my castle unbarricaded. It takes a lot of work and I am fighting it every day and I am tired of it and most of all, it is all my fault because I let it progress.

If I was strong enough to notice it and fight it when I was young, I would probably have a stronger mentality and able to fight it in a confident manner.

I am 23 right now and I am going to therapy and I am looking back and I am noticing how much I fucked up my life during those past 10 years. If only I was strong enough to fight back. If only I wasn’t so weak. If only I was aware that my mind is turning against me. If only I was not so pathetic. 

Yes, I know that I am 23 and I know that I am a young adult but I am not 15 years old neither 20. I am in my final year at university and I am in an all-or-nothing stage right now and I am at a great risk of not getting a decent job or failing at all *(and if I do that, my mind is going to love to bully me)*. I feel like the entire world is on my shoulders and I am finding it entirely hard to be focused on my studies when I have to simultaneously be cautious of my abusive and manipulative mind.  I cannot think straight most of the time. I am indeed much better than how I was before but I only scratched the surface.

I tried to fight back as much as I can during those 10 years, but with the little resources and support that I had, I was not able to do much and I felt disappointed in myself.

Every day, I wake up feeling embarrassed and angry that I am still alive and every day, I have to fight against constant self-criticism that is hindering my thinking and my logic *(when you are at university, you have to be at your peak. Even though being a student is not easy, having to fight against your own head and fighting against your own emotions and the unfinished business of the anger that you feel towards the people who wronged you, that is extra pressure)*

My therapist called me a brave man one day but I don’t think I am one.

If I saw, I would have taken care of my mind years ago. If I was, I would have stood up to the bullies and my parents for abusing my power *(heck, to this day, I am cautious of what to say because I don’t want my room to be a mess and I don’t want my school work torn apart. But I cannot do much because I have nowhere to go and the law has too much protection on the parents and little on their children. Plus I am over 18 of age so legally speaking, I am supposedly sometimes who should take care of himself)*

I felt like I was thrown to the wolves when I was a kid and it made me very scared and that fear got stuck ever since. I am right now stuck in a constant battle of being paranoid with everyone around me because we all know how cruel and ugly the world is and how everyone can turn against each other easily, whether it is because of ignorance, or because of egos, or personal interest; while at the same time, I am trying to see the good of the world *(the problem is, this is my first time interacting with others which will make me as ass of myself because I have poor social skills and when I am trying to interact with other students at the university campus, I feel like an idiot walking among geniuses.)*


The bottom line is this ….

**NEVER, EVER be afraid to stand up for yourself. No matter how afraid you are or no matter how much everything seems to be against you. Be brave and be strong. And never, ever give up in your dreams and goals. Enjoy life as much as you can because you may not have a chance to enjoy it as much in the future**

**P.S** - I am sorry for the long message

September 2016: my boyfriend of twelve years broke up with me. He left me because he couldn't deal with me being down after graduating, and didn't want to give me times to get back up on my feet.
Within three weeks he met a girl on Tinder. 

October 2016: he said he still loved me. Five days later, november, he got in a relastionship with her, after only meeting her for the first time.

March 2017: after still visiting me during his entire relationship (yes, cheating with me), he said we needed to talk. His new girl was six weeks pregnant. After hearing, for thirteen straight years, he never wanted kids, he's out of this world happy. He barely knows her three months.

March-Yesterday: I'm breaking every. single. day. Eveything I fought for, for over thriteen years, she gets. His first reaction finding out he'll be a dad. Telling everyone around them. Yesterday I found out he heard the heartbeat of the baby. All those firsts I wanted with him, and that I fought for (believe me, those years were HARD, but we had eachother). Everything I deseve with him, she gets it. They're moving in together, starting their family, and I'm here, all alone. Crying every single day.

Yesterday: my best (girl)friend of twelve years followed my best friend. She blocked me everywhere without as much as a reason why. We didn't have a fight, she just kept ignoring me and eventually blocked me. It was the first time in all those years I said I actually nééded her. And she went away.

Today: I've always been there for fucking everyone who needed me. Eveyone can call me in the middle of the fucking night and I'll answer, hell I'm probably already on my way towards you. And eveyone just leaves. I've lost everything I fought for, everyone I thought who loved me. All of it.

I don't want to keep going anymore. I'm done. I can't take anymore. I've been crying every damn day for the last seven months. 

It only gets worse.

I'm getting to a point where the phrase ""If it exists, it's uninteresting"" applies. And this isn't a dramatization, but an actual summary of my world view at the moment. The only thing I can imagine myself interested in is something so strange, I cannot conceive of its existence.

Interest is a weird topic. You can't fake it. I've read tons of books, listened to many educational podcasts, and tried making my own music. No spark at all. I've even done the traditional methods for getting out of apathy, such as meditation, exercise, and a better diet.

She's stayed a total of 9 days in the hospital and came out Great the first day then she slept and it all went back to square one. She's a zombie. She's been on Zoloft for a week and a half and really nothing changed. I'm losing my patience sadly, it's just frustrating. I love her so damn much. But it's almost like she's never going to come back. She's always down and sad. She never wants to do anything. She's like a zombie. 

I'm frustrated cause I have had some big things to do these next few months-years with school, and I want to enjoy it. But I can't when my mom could be on the brink of something anytime soon. I've hung out with her a few times and every time she says things like ""I lost my body"" and other concerning things.

I'm constantly on the move, like literally on the move. I've lived in numerous cities, houses, apartments, even have lived in different countries to try to run from my depression. 

I moved from apartment to apartment in New York and got this excitement about the ""Fresh"" and ""New"" life I would live there. The excitement lasted about 3 months, then I'd get depressed and start looking for the next place to be excited about. I decided to make a huge leap and I moved to England where I was working for a large pharmaceutical company in a very ""pant suit-esque"" position. This excited me for about 6 months, I enjoyed the English countryside, then the depression hit me again. I quit my job and I decided to buy a van with my new English partner and do this whole vanlife hippe blah blah free living... I thought this would be the solution as I would be able to literally keep moving. We drove down to Greece together and did lots of Humanitarian work for about three months (BAM - Depression again). I can continue telling stories about moving and getting depressed but I think you understand there is a cycle. We're now selling the van and I'm about to move again to another country and I'm worried how I'll handle my depression there. 

Any advice?",/r/depression/comments/69rbcx/running_away_from_depression/
539,1494164277,IGOTBRAINPROBLEMS,Living Life in a Haze,"As early I can remember I've felt like a passenger in my own life; nothing was in my control. It's a strange feeling, it feels like I'm indifferent to life and I'm passively witnessing it go by. Today, I feel as if it has only gotten worse like I'm permanently cemented in a state of inertia. My friendships are few and I can count all the significant life experiences I've had on one hand. I'm witnessing the people who I grew up with have more fulfilling lives whereas I feel incapable of lifting a finger. 

Everyday I wake up, bang my head against the wall in an attempt to learn programming and begin a career as a Web Developer. Despite the grind nothing has come to fruition. The most severe problem I have is execution. Frequently, I've spent a great deal of my time ""studying"" (scribbling into a notebook) and I'm all too much of a stranger to building projects. From what I've noticed, this pattern is also evident in other facets of my life. Last year alongside learning Web Development, I'd decided to learn how to play guitar. The exact same pattern emerged and I found myself yet again content with complacency by playing the same songs over and over again. Complacency and the lack of courage to change direction has been a prevalent motif all my life. As of tonight, I'm interested in breaking the cycle. 

This is the first time I'm openly seeking advice on the matter and I'm aware that what I've described here will most likely confuse people. It is not lost on me that if Occam's Razor were applied you could summarize that I'm only just stupid and lazy. In fact, it may be exactly what I need to read at this point. In contradictory to the sub's rules, I'm personally allowing you to dish out Tough Love. However, for those who are in a similar situation as mine I'd be interested in reading how you're currently dealing / dealt with feeling like a passenger. How do you stop going around in circles?

540,1494164350,amnana,How can I help my little brother who is struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide?,"My younger brother (15) has been struggling with depression for the last two years and I've been his major contact throughout that time. I live in a different city for Uni so I only see him in person every couple of weeks for a few days.

Our parents don't have the best attitude about mental health. They take the approach that he is just ""going through his teenage years"" even when it got very serious and scary. I discovered that he had been self-harming a year ago and forced him to go and see a psychologist. The psychologist didn't work out. He never opened up to her. They spent most of their weekly 2-hour sessions discussing stress from school work and formulating schedules for better time-management. It was so shitty. Because I knew that he has so much he needed to talk to someone about and she wasn't asking the right questions.

After 6-months of this, he said that he was fine and didn't need to see his psychologist anymore and my mother, thinking that he was finally over this ""weird period"", cancelled the appointments.

It's been half a year since him and I have had a major chat about suicide but it came up again today and he sounds as angry and upset and visceral as I have ever heard him.

I am so worried. I don't know what to do. He doesn't want to see any other psychologists. My mother and father won't hear me out when I tell them that he is definitely depressed and suicidal because they feel like I'm crying wolf now.

The worst bit about the whole thing is I know how much he will love his time after high school. He's just not built mentally to deal with the day-to-day shit that comes from being at a high school where people don't understand you. He has so many passions and he is so smart, this boy has taught himself how to program computers from scratch, is doing university level Maths for fun and can recite every Rick and Morty episode from heart (the best success of all).

I just feel helpless and I don't know what I can do as his older sister. If anyone has ever been through something like this it would really help me to know what you said/did to help.",/r/depression/comments/69rc83/how_can_i_help_my_little_brother_who_is/

I see other 'normal' people, and they all seem to be really close with a couple of people.  Whether it be one of their parents/ siblings/ other relatives, or maybe just a close friend, gf or bf, everyone seems to have someone whom they would tell everything and ask for advice etc.

To stand tall and wave good bye to the anxiety and sad expression

I want so much to go back, to the me I used to be

Full of dreams and aspirations, so bubbly and friendly

The me who loved to have fun and smiled with sincerity

The me who stood with pride, someone people used to envy

I remember true happiness, when everything was just right

Past experiences brought me down, sure, but I always saw the light

And yet things haven't been the same, not since she passed away..

My sister, my best friend, we were together everyday

20 years making memories then one day she was gone

I'll never forget the pain and yet it's been so long

7 years to be exact but seems like it was just yesterday

Despite losing my sister, I still pray everyday
My faith keeps me strong and helps me to get through

With christ by my side I know there's nothing I can't do

This depression has me trapped isolation is key

To how depression wins the game so you feel alone, sad and empty

But depression doesn't know that God is everywhere

No matter how tough it gets, with God I never fear

He gives me courage to be brave and strength when I'm weak

When I'm lost and afraid he shines his light for me to seek

A safe place of refuge from depression and anxiety

It's here that I remember to fight back and break free...

561,1494172701,franksinatraisbest,"I have no ambition, no desires, no interests, and just waste my time on video games and sleep.","I don't even know how to write this out. I think a lot of it will be a conglomerate of other people's words that I relate to exactly, but they put it in a much better way than I could have. Here it goes:

I feel empty. Nothing in life excites me. I don't have any ambition to do anything and I don't desire to do anything except sleep. My mind is constantly just blank and I zone out a ton, not because I can't focus, but because there is just no point to. I'm a 20 year old male in college, and I have just switched to computer science as a major despite never having done it before. I figured it will be the path of least resistance for me so that my paycheck isn't pathetic and yet the work is easy. Make it easy for future me to live I guess. So far I haven't gone to my classes unless attendance is required. There just doesn't seem to be a point to going. I don't enjoy the class and I just zone out when I go there because it is so boring so it is typically just a waste of time to go, especially since they teach at such a slow pace. Instead I just study the night before the test and get a B or C in the class. Not great, but it's the only level of motivation I have. I should get F's with how I do schooling. Every day I just sit inside sleeping and playing video games. I hang out with my friends once or twice on the weekends because they ask me to and I have nothing better to do. At least it takes me away from video games and sleeping and internet browsing. We smoke weed quite often during those times we hangout, but occasionally we go outside hiking or swimming or something which is nice.

Pretty soon school is going to end and I'm going to probably work at Walmart during summer. I'm absolutely dreading it. My parents have been trying to help me get better (put me on prozac), but it just makes me feel like shit. They tell me things I need to do like sign up for classes, fill out a job application, etc. but I just can't bring myself to do it because of how little I care about anything. If I don't get the job so what, it means nothing to me because I don't really even care if I come back to college or have money or whatever. It's all equally boring and meaningless to me. This leads me to have to lie to them a lot about how I'm feeling better or I've been doing things so that they don't feel like I'm blowing off their efforts...but this makes me feel like shit because now I'm both not doing anything and I have to lie to them and now I'm stuck in having to keep these lies up all the time otherwise they will see through it. I still haven't signed up for classes or sent in my job application even though I need to so badly. I say I'm feeling better so that they don't feel like putting me on prozac was a waste monetarily on their part and so they don't have to worry about me so much. 

Hanging out with people has become harder and harder for me as I've been apathetic for so long and done so little. When someone asks me what I've been up to for 2 years I can genuinely say that I have done nothing. There has been almost no progress except dating a serious girlfriend for a year. I don't remember almost anything I have learned in my classes over the last 2 years, I have done nothing productive. I don't like to learn stuff because it is all so boring. Idk if I ever liked learning, but I know that currently I can't seem to find interest in absolutely anything. I can't look people in the eyes because my smiles aren't genuine in response to jokes. Spending time 1 on 1 with others is the hardest because I just simply have nothing to say. No new information is coming in either. I fake smile to jokes so that others still want to hang out with me and don't think I'm as empty as I am. I try to listen to others, but I just zone out when they talk most of the time and afterwards I can never remember what we talked about. Not being able to smile genuinely has got to be the hardest part because it makes me feel fake. Same with not looking others in the eyes. I also lie to others about trying to do things, or things I'm working on so that they don't see me as a lazy loser that is doing nothing with his life. I feel like others get bored with my too which haunts me while I hang out with them (especially 1 on 1) because I have nothing to say, havn't had anything to say, and have no emotional footprint. I try to come up with things to say just to stop the silence now because it gives me so much anxiety thinking about others being so bored with hanging out with me that they stop spending time with me.

I've been losing weight lately (lost 16 points in 2 months) because my appetite has went away mostly. I tried fixing my sleeping schedule a while back but I didn't stick to it because it just didn't suit me I guess. College social life is difficult and the weekends always fucked up my schedule so that it never stuck. I also take so many naps during the day (sometimes 2 or 3) since I'm just always tired. Video games and netflix are the only distractions that work for me since everything else takes too much effort(aside from weed and hanging with friends on the weekends).

I never tackle challenges because it seems like so much work right now, and it seems meaningless to do it anyway so why bother. 

The overarching issue, which was similar to a post I had seen before, is that I am apathetic about anything and everything. Nothing makes an emotional impact on me that would give me drive. Nothing excites me or interests me and everything is boring. I havn't enjoyed video games(unless sometimes with a friend) in a long time, but at least it distracts me from sitting on my bed thinking about literally nothing zoned out at a wall. I'm not sad, I'm just utterly empty. I'm not suicidal yet because I couldn't put my parents through something as painful as that (it would just be selfish), but I would be lying if I said the thought of it wasn't appealing every once in a while. I can tell what would be good or me to do, and analytically speaking I can tell that helping people is the best way to live my life, but I just can't make myself care about doing any of it. No career interests or even appeals to me, and neither does anything else for that sake (aside from pickleball and d&amp;d which I have been trying to gather the energy to go start for 6 months now. How fucking pathetic is that). I'm dreading having to work at walmart this summer, but I need money to live off campus since my dad can't pay for it all currently. 

Recently I have found something really helpful, which is that I ""shouldn't"" be doing anything with my life. The only reason I care is because society has told me I should be doing something with my life, and that I feel as though I will never find a wife or partner in life if I have no ambition, aspirations, desires, or interests. I feel like they'll just get bored with me since I'm not doing anything new or achieving anything. This is all bullshit though and I realize now that at least if I am honest with them I will know that if they are with me, they are with me because of who I am rather than the things I have done or the lies I tell. Still though, I'd rather not lose friends, or a partner, or others respect because I don't do anything with my life. The problem now is that everything is boring even after realizing this and even realizing that I can do anything I want, I just don't have a desire to do anything. The only desire I have is to do something fun, yet nothing is fun or appealing. I could continue sleeping and video games and internet surfing but that is boring too.

There are no negative thoughts in my head I don't think that are weighing me down, because my mind is just blank constantly. I don't have anything to think about other than the fact that I'm not thinking about anything and that nothing is fun or interesting and I'd like to find something fun or interesting. Everything above is what goes through my head, but I've thought about them for so long(2 years) that I no longer need to spend time thinking about them. It has just become normal life. I'd like to have goals or desires or interests...or anything to bring back the joy of life.

This has been what has been going on with me. Here's hoping someone has some advice haha.",/r/depression/comments/69rzmb/i_have_no_ambition_no_desires_no_interests_and/

565,1494173687,ThankYouMrBen,How do I know if I should check myself into a hospital?,"Long history of depression. Father died by suicide after battling bipolar. His father was bipolar. I'm ""only"" MDD, not bipolar.

In the midst of the worst episode of my life. Not yet feeling like I'm about to self-harm, but starting to think about it more.

Can't focus on much. I'm afraid of the disruption a hospitalization would cause my wife and young children. Obviously more afraid of what a more permanent course of action would do to my kids (since I've grown up knowing my father died by suicide). Can't do that to them, but it's starting to feel like the easier choice.

Recently taken off of all of my anti-depressants to clear my system before starting emsam. I'm halfway into the two-week period between stopping the other meds and starting the emsam.

I'm a professional whose job impacts many, many people. Anything that is different from me doing my job is going to be public and humiliating for me and/or my family. Not really sure what to do.

Any ideas?",/r/depression/comments/69s2w0/how_do_i_know_if_i_should_check_myself_into_a/

Recently my friend has been trying to make me feel like some awful person because I like metal. Seriously? She also tells me not to argue because ""that would prove that she's right"". She has nothing to say to me unless it's about how horrible I am for listening to that music.

She used to be the first person I would go to if I was upset. But now, she shows no concern or care about my problems, and it hurts so much because she used to show so much. I've always been there for her and cared for her. But now she often ignores me and doesn't talk unless it's about how I'm some terrible person because I like listening to Pantera.

I think she does so she can try to seem like a better person. I don't know. I feel like I'm overreacting, I was in tears because of all this. I hate myself for being such a pussy. But I just have always showed so much care and concern for her, yet she no longer returns it to me.

Maybe this isn't the best subreddit for this, but I think my depression makes this a lot more painful and makes me react more of a piece of shit than someone who isn't depressed. I just feel like she doesn't care about me anymore. It's all about that stupid fucking music. I bet if we had never talked about our tastes in music, we would be fine in our friendship.

Maybe part of it is that she has a boyfriend now so she no longer shows any care for me now. Fuck, I just want to be her friend again, but I'm so sensitive and broken from other things. I just want her to show some concern and care, like I always have for her. I hate myself for being so unlikable or whatever, I just want to cry into someone's arms right now.

A few days ago I blocked her for about 12 hours, but my dad was saying he was going to kill himself and I was just so damn upset at everything. I tried to vent to her but she showed very little care at all. She used to show so much. When we barley knew each other, she was so much kinder.

Come 2017 and it still isnt good. Im a junior in college and i dont wanna even go to school anymore. Im doing all the classes when i feel as if im not going to do anything anyway, plus whatever i do ends up being outdown by my little sister anyway. Its gotten to the point where i dont wanna try anymore. Little things happen as well. Classes i wanna take getting filled, having to continue a language when i should be finished, getting bad grades. I didnt even want to go to my college, i did cause of a scholarship to save my patents money, plys the didnt want me to go far. I lost the scholarship but they still dont pay. My sister left for a out of state school. 

My friends have all abandoned me. They have their own friends that they hangout with while im alone. We go to different colleges in the city. Im spend most of my days alone. We have neen friends for years, 
But even my best friends have left me. My parents feel entitled to my life. If i dont wanna talk about something they get mad.

I try to smoke weed and drink to help but i got caught with weed not to long ago and my parents dont like alcohol in the house. Im 21 but i too nervous to go to a bar by myself

I have a hard time talking to people, especially the opposite sex, cause i dont know wat to talk about. Plus it really hurts when someone has a negative opinion of me. 

I wont amount to anything in life and i dont even have a life now. Im a loser who just plays video games all day with no motivation for anything. Im afraid to apply for a job, so im pretty much at the mercy of my parents. At the same time people i know are doing all these things that are cool that they want, but i am happy for them. I feel like such a loser. Especially when compared to my little sister. Since middle school she outdid me in everything. I get a good job while she gets a omg or you gonna do great things. I go to college, everyone just says have fun. She goes people throw parties, wishing her good luck all over social media.

I just want to die. I think about just jumping into the tracks when im waiting for a train, hoping a train will hit me or touching the 3rd rail would kill me. Ive thought of down the line getting a gun licence to kill myself (i dont know how else to get a gun). I though about using an exit bag to kill myself. Stabbinh myself with a kitchen knife. I havent done anything yet cause im afraid of the pain or failing at it.

Even if something good happens and i forget, these feeling comeback to me. I dont wanna do this anymore, i wish i was never born, never existed. ",/r/depression/comments/69sasl/i_just_want_to_die/

Scared to take it again.,"I started Wellbutrin 6 days ago, and in the first 4 days I was supposed to take 1 150mg tablet a day, and I did. Day 5 and onwards I take 1 when I wake up, and another 8 hours later.

The first night of taking 2 was fine until about 1am when I just lost it. Usually reading stuff on reddit never set me off, but I feel it's no coincidence that the first day I start taking this stuff twice is the first time I've ever gone into full anxiety attack. I felt so cold, uncontrollable shaking, dry mouth, having to piss every 10 minutes, it was horrible.

I was told the good effects of Wellbutrin don't kick in until 4-6 weeks, and to think I'm not even a week into it and this happens. I want to feel better, and I'm willing to wait 4-6 weeks, but not if this is gonna become a common occurrence.

The last 2 years in the relationship I became mentally unstable and knew i am going to end it with my girlfriend because the age difference makes me stressed...... but i keep procrastinating and changing my mind....

when i finally came to my senses i broke up with her not knowing what i had done.....

apparently in her country (Peru we lived there together for 3 year) it is almost impossible to get married above 30.....

I know it is her fault too for staying with me all those years i was clearly emotional not well , 

i had 0 friends i didn't speak the language i was whole time in my room....

But i feel extremely guilty because she could find some to marry at 28-30 but know it is really late for that and she always wanted a traditional family etc......

other hand i feel angry at her she knew i was 17 but i didn't knew she was 26 when we started (i thought 21)

i feel angry at my parents they never asked me when i left the country or emailed me this whole situation was preventable.

but i still care/love about her she was really sweet and nice with me (that is why took so long with breaking off)....

now she tells me her life is ruined and i offered her to take her to Europe....

she agreed but the process is insanely difficult/expensive and she is not cooperating...

I don't think she has the intelligence to immigrate to Europe or i am afraid she will make a mistake with will ruin the whole process....

It will take some years to go to Europe and 5 years to receive her residence.... 

I told her it is better that she goes looking for a relationship with some one older and who wants to settle down.... because after 35 than it is 100% over....

588,1494179081,alexmarie12,Friendship advice,"So, here's the thing, I have clinical depression and I've had it for around ten years and so does my best friend. So, we have this relationship where we can relate to each other and I love that, but I feel like it's more poisonous than helpful.

I'm the type of person that tries to fix everyone's problems and she's the type of person who isn't socially mature enough to help other people. So, we have an unfair give and take relationship which didn't bother me before but now it does. Probably because I need some comfort and she can't give me any.

It especially went downhill when I left to study abroad for a year and she decided to cut herself off from me emotionally in order to save herself. Which really hurt my sense of self-worth. I felt like I was only useful to her when I was giving and she was taking, and that I was easily replaceable. I did call her out on it and she apologized and promised to do better, but she went back to the same routine as before.

This put a huge strain on our relationship and now I can feel it crumple. Which really sucks because she is one of the three friends I have and they'll all take her side, I know it. And honestly, it's not anybody's fault. So, my real question is whether I should try to work for this relationship, let it crumble, or cut it off?

(Also, she's going to college in California [I live in NY] next year, so, a huge part of me thinks I should let it fade, but it still hurts and I feel like I need closure, and another part is desperate to keep my best friend because we used to plan our future today.

600,1494182201,croma0910,I'm worried for a friend and I need a second opinion on this...,"So recently my friend has opened up to me about his depression. I have been giving all the advice I can but the reality is that I know nothing about what he's going through. I'm trying my best to get him through this, but I have no psychological background whatsoever and I have no idea really what to do or say. I have suggested that he seek professional help but he has absolutely ruled it out. I think he is nervous that he isn't ""depressed enough"" or his problems aren't significant enough to warrant professional help. He says he only wishes to confide about it to those he knows very well (Bear in mind I've known this guy for 4 years and he only told me everything two weeks ago). 


So let me start with the basics of what his problems are. My friend, (we'll call him Craig for now) never really struck me as having depression. But recently he has been telling me that he has had suicidal instincts. He no longer values his own life, for example sometimes he walks into the road to get hit by a car or starts pushing a knife towards himself, only to be thrown off doing it at the last minute (he once told me he even tried to cut off his own body fat). He used to be so health conscious when it came to drugs that he wouldn't even smoke vape pens but now he is considering heroin. I ask him why, and he says that he doesn't feel like carrying on sometimes. He says every day feels the same, and he feels like he needs something new in his life. I tell him that drugs will only make everything worse but he responds with the ""we'll all die anyway"" line (I'm religious and he isn't so we have a natural disagreement there). I tell him that he's not lonely, his life is going so well and he has all of his friends with him but he says he needs some new experience and he doesn't know what. He wants to find a hobby, meet new people and do new things yet the hobbies he does just aren't cutting it and he says his depression makes it hard for him to make new friends with confidence. 
He says he doesn't see what there is to do in life. I told him to imagine all the things he can do, he says there's no point to it all. Generally, he's having a very pessimistic view.
He told me he also wants to know a girl he can just talk to and laugh to, I tell him that, well, there are girls we're friends with and we can talk to (albeit they live on the other side of the world, it's a long story) and he's the one that has had the most girlfriends and got the furthest with them out of all of us. 
This seems to be a recurring theme with him: He's doing so well in something yet he thinks he's lacking. I'm really worried, we've reached an age where drugs are all around us and so easy to get and I'm worried he's going to start messing with the wrong shit and get even worse. 

All I want is for him to be happy, to go back to the days when he had a positive outlook on life and for him to see life for the gift it is. I ask anyone who's had any of my friend's feelings and attitudes before or know anything about them, how did you cope with them and how did you get a better outlook on life??

601,1494182447,frogscreech,Loneliness of high-functioning depression,"I'm incredibly thankful for the parts of my brain that have allowed me to be as functional as I am. But I find myself wishing (often) that I could make my distress visible. Yes, I'm creative, I'm curious, I get A's, I'm double majoring; I've been instilled with a demanding need to seek achievement. That won't change the fact that I come home almost every night and force myself to cry quietly enough that my roommate won't notice. 

I'm amazed at the capacity of human beings to wipe from our minds that which we don't want to remember. Several of my friends know I'm suicidal - they've had to step in during some of the worst nights. Unless I'm completely at the edge, though, I force myself to appear happy, and I'm good at it. But I wish that wasn't confused for real, lasting happiness. I wish I could tell them how hard I'm trying, and that it's for their sake, and how badly I wish I could just be selfish and cry and cry and cry. I wish they would just check in on me more; they like to think I'm just a sensitive chick.

I could go on, but I'm sure you understand the gist of it. The worst feeling is knowing that if you don't talk to your friends and family about how you're feeling, they'll be insensitive, demanding, and they'll brush aside your hints at suicidal feelings. But if you do truly tell them, it's too much for them, they were unprepared, they don't know how to handle it, and they don't want to live with you next year (roommate) because your depression is just too overwhelming and they'd just be too worried about you.

I feel more hopeless than ever because by every visible metric of success - grades, physical appearance, creative ability - I've come quite a good way from where I was last semester (when I was significantly less functional.) But it's becoming more and more evident that it doesn't change anything. No matter how well you're doing, your nights can still be just as terrifying and painful, just as frequently. The disturbing irony is that I hate myself more the better I'm doing because I have less and less ""excuses"" to feel so upset.

He became extremely depressed. For months he wouldn't get out of bed or eat properly. I encouraged him to take a year out to sort himself out. He went to the doctor and refused to take anti-depressants prescribed. He intended on going back to college to finish his degree again but ended up in a worse depression than before. 

Fast forward another year he visited a councillor for a few months and it seemed like he was slightly improving but as soon as it ended he went back into a deep depression.  He insisted that it didn't help at all and that nothing can help him. 

He has lost all of his friends and doesn't leave his bedroom. He wakes up in the evening and goes to sleep in the morning. I have no idea what to do he always says he hates his life and he doesn't have a reason to get out of bed. No matter what I say he won't change his mind.

 It's like he has completely given up on life and I think he might do something. I am so worried and don't know what to do.  Can anyone please give me advice?",/r/depression/comments/69sxhl/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_son/

611,1494184761,Shadowgirl7,"Grief, how to deal with it","I suffer from depression and anxiety but right now that's not what brings me here. 

My grandfather, who lived with me and my parents, passed away yesterday. I had never lost someone as meaninful. My grandmother (his wife) died when I was 12 and my parents sent me away on a three week vacation so I wouldn't have to go through stuff. I'd say this is my first serious experience with loss. 

My family is broken, which makes it worst. My mom and dad don't get along, my grandfather never liked my mom and my mom was angry with him. I grew up in a context of lack of love and some psychological abbuse. Because of that I don't get along with them that much. I mean, I don't hate them,but since they are toxic, to protect me I just created a safety distance towards all my family. 

I know my grandfather's dead was for the best, I knew he had given up on life for a long time and wished to die. He stopped caring, and he missed my grandmother. Plus right now he was suffering from multiple conditions that were causing him pain.

However I feel sad because I wish he had have a happier life ending. I feel guilty because I could have been more loving. Like I said, I kept some distance from them because i felt hurt and needed to protect me, but now I can't help but feel it was selfish. Finally, i feel worried about my dad. He grew up sheltered by my grandparents and he is currently unemployed so he just lost his support net. My mom doesn't get along with him (it's complex, she has a difficult personality, but he is to blame as well) and my relation with him is very very strained. He is sort of childish and selfish and never really took care of me or took responsability for me. I mean I don't hate him either, and I don't feel resentful, but in the context of my family dynamics, I am uncapable of going there and hug him.

At the same time I am 24 and feel I haven't lived anything. All my family (uncles, aunts, etc) keep saying I have to be strong and help my dad and brother, but nobody seems to really remember me. I didn't cry a lot at the funeral because I don't like to show feelings in public, maybe they think it didn't affect me. I really don't have anyone to talk to about it (honeslty I don't think I'd be capable because then I'd start crying and I hate to cry in front of people) so yeah just venting here.

613,1494185271,MC_White_Rice,Starting over and being ghosted,"The last few moths have sucked. Over a year really. I needed to get away from my parents so I moved away and spent a year with friends. That was alright but too stagnant. Even though I had decent jobs I was overworked, underpaid, and felt financially taken advantage of by those around me. Relationships started straining and I needed an out. I had more family across the country and found good mutual support with my cousin who was becoming my best friend. So I packed up and moved thousands of miles away, thinking that a change of location would help my mental issues. That it was primarily a situational depression.

Things were good for a while. My aunt and uncle let me stay at their place for a while because I was such good friends with my cousin, but their family had their own issues they were dealing with and eventually I was passed over to my grandpa a few cities away while I waited to hear back from a job close to where my apartment would be.

The commute was terrible. Three hours in the car every day to a job through a temp agency. I didn't have a doctor yet either. Still don't, and I can't afford to see a psychologist. Just waiting for the system to get around to me. My cousin, who has similar mental health issues as me, of course had a doctor and got the prescription they needed. Im glad they got what they needed, but seeing the contrast in how I was doing compared to them hurt. I tried meditating, but I needed medication.

One day after work, about three months ago, I started having a panic attack. I texted my cousin asking for help because usually we could help each other through them. But this was worse. By far my worst panic attack to date that I wouldn't event call the previous ones actual attacks, just... I don't know... depressed funks? I sent them a snapchat so they could hear what I was going through, and less than a half hour later I found that they had deleted and blocked me off all social media, text included. Completely ghosted.

So there I am, still freaking out because everything had piled up and I couldn't stand it anymore. The one person I really felt comfortable talking to I couldn't. I asked my uncle and some of their friends what had happened, but apparently even asking for details made things worse.

Since then I've talked to a mental health counselor (only once because I moved closer to work shortly after and everything he said I knew already. The reminder was helpful tho). Its been about three months now and I've heard a bit from my cousin but we haven't actually met up yet. I still don't have the answers I need and its killing me because our friendship meant everything to me. Enough to make me move across the country. I feel more stable in myself but I'm still so hurt, embarrassed, and ashamed that I not only let myself get to that point but I dumped it on them (at midnight) while they were trying to focus on school.

If things don't get better soon I'm going to have to move again and I hate that idea. I've moved once a year for the last 3 or 4 years. It's too much.

It came time for me to renew my application and as stated, my application was rejected. I am now told I have to buy health insurance which I cannot afford. I only made $4000 last year and am currently working the same seasonal position I was working last year. So I am set to make roughly the same amount of money this year. The NJ FamilyCare website claims that a single independent (which I am) has to make below $1387 a month to be eligible for Medicaid. Even during my seasonal work, I still don't make $1387 a month. I tried getting them on the phone to understand why my application was rejected, but I either get bounced around automated machine messages or I get told I'm not allowed to speak to a supervisor. No one is helping me and now I have to file an appeal and take it to court and I don't know what to do or what I'm doing. I can't afford to pay for insurance. I don't make ANY money for more than half the year. I can't go without my doctor's appointments and meds. I feel so lost. I can't think straight.

I've been pushing down a panic attack for like an hour now but I know it's just going to explode. IDK what I'm going to do. I've got maybe 4 antidepressant tablets left. I'm freaking out. Last time I went off my meds. I slammed my head into a wall repeatedly until I had post-concussion syndrome and was out of it for 4 months. I've been clinically depressed since I was 9.

Sure, there are quite a few conversations in my messages on my phone, but none of them are conversations where someone reached out to me first and we had a conversation just to talk/hang out.

The only messages I have are my mom/dad, stuff for classes with group projects here and there(semester has ended now), and stuff like some of my ""friends"" when we were arranging times to meet for arbitrary stuff. Nothing social whatsoever.

By this, I mean I could literally power off my phone and log out of my media for the entire summer, and by September have 0 messages or notifications(other than birthdays on facebook.)
Except I cant do this, because I need to communicate with my parents/work with my phone, so im left with the torture of empty notifications all summer.

And i'm not trying to sit on my pity porch here. Believe me, i've tried to reach out first in the past few years, but really that's all my interactions consist of. When I don't reach out, no one talks to me at all. I feel like I really don't matter to anyone sometimes. It just makes me so tired when Im the only one trying to keep my social life going. Even though my ""friends"" probably don't hate me, it certainly doesn't help when they don't even notice you when you seem drop off the face of the earth...

Loneliness is probably the worst aspect of my depression, and there's periods of time when I cope with it really well, actually, particularly during the year when im already so busy. But it's times like the summer when it hits you the hardest and you have no one.

629,1494188114,thrwwy957,Hey there,"Hello,

I am not sure if this is the correct place to post, but here it goes. 

I posted on reddit about my struggles multiple times before using throwaway accounts. I suffer from anxiety and major depressive disorder.  Last 7 months or so were probably the hardest time of my life in terms of my mental condition; I had a lot to deal with, and on top of everything I fell in love with my landlord/housemate in a way I never experienced before. I'm thinking maybe that was the first time I truly fell for someone, and boy was it painful. 

I was thinking about suicide a lot. I did a considerable amount of research, as a result of which I decided on a couple of suicide methods. I ordered a book about euthanasia, but the order was cancelled because I didn't meet the requirements to buy it (I am younger than 50). I was still able to find a used copy of it online. That weekend I was also planning to get CPL training, which is required to buy a gun. Same week I visited my doctor for the first time to establish primary care (I moved to a new city recently). She asked me some questions and started to panic after hearing my answers. She sent me to ER where I was told to check in to the pysch unit. If I didn't check myself in, my doctor would get a court order to make sure I stayed at the hospital. 

I spent 10 days at the pysch unit where my medication was adjusted. Everyday I spoke with physicians, nurses, student nurses, doctors for hours. I told the person I fell for that I developed feelings for him when he visited me at the hospital only to hear that he did not feel the same way, which unfortunately was expected. I was devastated, I cried a lot, the doctors were seriously concerned about me. I didn't have a support system; I had to ask a coworker I met just a month ago whether I could stay with him for a few days after I got discharged, because the doctors wouldn't let me go without making sure I would be fine after I left. Thankfully he let me stay with him, and he helped me move out that weekend. For some time I thought I made a mistake by moving out because I missed my housemate a lot, I cried that whole weekend, and I still thought about suicide. But I kept taking my pills, I showed up for my appointments, told my therapist and doctor I was still struggling, started running with the running group in town, started going to bars in hopes of making friends even though I can't drink because of medication.

It has been a month since I got discharged. I have been trying to be as busy as possible to keep myself distracted. Most days I don't even get enough sleep because I come home fairly late (and I can't sleep well in the first place). The reason I'm explaining all of this is, I am glad that my doctor sent me to ER that day. I never thought I would stay in a pysch unit at any point in my life, and I would never check in by myself for two reasons. 1) I didn't think it was an option for me, 2) I didn't think I could take a break from everything (job, etc.) by going to the hospital. Once I got into the hospital I realized it needed to happen. It was a timely intervention. 

I still have things to worry about. I still think about him every once in a while, but I try to distract myself when I realize that. Most of the time I don't think about suicide anymore. For so many years I lived in fear and frustration. I'm working on changing that now, because it didn't get me anywhere except the hospital. Slowly my mindset is changing in good way. I'm telling myself not to worry about things I have no control over. It doesn't always work, but I'm getting there. 

I wrote all of this to encourage you to take care of yourself. Maybe you reached out to people with no good results, maybe you don't even have anybody to speak with, maybe you called suicide hotlines only to hang up the phone disappointed. Consider checking in to psychiatric unit, regardless of what you think about it. It is not easy being in such a place for a long period of time where you are surrounded by people like  you and don't have any contact with the outside world. But it may help. It may be the beginning of your recovery. At least that was the case for me. There are professionals who can understand what you are going through and know how to help. Most medical people I spoke with did not only know the theory, but they had first hand experience with depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc. which made it easier to communicate with them. Think about taking the initiative. You never know what the outcome will be, but it may (and hopefully will) be a happy one in the long term.

I hope this helps someone.",/r/depression/comments/69thtp/hey_there/
630,1494188224,RPGSadPanda,Not having what I want is making my life terrifying,"I don't mean I want some material thing, not in any sense. I just want some stupid peaceful life where I don't need to be alone anymore. But I also can't ruin some poor girl's life to have it.

I graduated high school as one of the first to do all four years of the Graphic Design course, and I loved doing it, for the first two and half years, but I eventually lost my feel for it, and started half-assing all of my work, just to get it done. Then I moved on to college, and recently decided to skip out on the summer classes this year because the stress of the work was getting to me. And now I'm at home, waiting to hear back from a job application, despite seemingly nobody wanting to hire me for whatever reason they have, and I have already realized I have no ambitions or motivations.

I stopped like graphic design, because it's unstable work. I stopped liking art because it's one of the hardest career paths to get into it, let alone have a stable job. I gave up on voice-acting because I can't find where to start, and I'm terrified of not having consistent work. I don't even want to finish college, because I'd be happy with some job at GameStop or Target or something, so long as I like it. But I realized I don't even want that.

I just want to have a wife, maybe a kid or two down the road, have a couple pets, and just stay at home to take care of the place, while providing support for the girl I fell in love with. Maybe live on some stupid little farm, I don't know. I can't handle the uncertainty in my life, and it's so hard living with such low motivation.

I'm a drain on most things and I don't like people that ask who I am. I fetishize suicide and I really hate myself for nearly everything in my life. The thoughts are the enemy, and the fact that I have them shows that I have weak resolve and a weak personality. The reason that others don't have issues with depression is because they don't. the reasoning is circular and the only way to escape it is just to act and actively take all the resources available to me and make my life better. I don't want to because I see all meaning as contrived and baseless. The only place that meaning comes from is the power to enforce that meaning. You can decide to believe in that meaning if you like, and that is how meaning thrives. All power is necessarily oppressive to those who don't have it, and those who don't have power can't have their voices heard or have their visions validated. That makes them weaker, and then cast aside by those who were stronger to begin with. There is no healing, once damaged, people never return to their original states. Thus, those who are successful in life don't have these issues, and never have. Meaning is derived from power, and power derived from meaning. Suicide doesn't solve this, it only makes matters worse. We are forced into the competition, and quitting only makes you lose. In fact, because all players understand this, those that waste time by observing only continue to lose. There is no learning, only doing. There is no option but to be social, to be competitive, and to be successful. Those who are not fade into oblivion, forgotten by society and the cruel reality of the world. In spite of the truth that the most successful are vastly more successful than everyone else, everyone must believe that they can be as well, because without that belief, you cannot continue. The Game, naturally organized, is perfect, and cannot be escaped. Success is meaning is happiness, and depression is failure, and failure breeds depression. Those that fail can only grow accustomed to that failure, and will continue to fail while the successful reap the things they lost. There is no salvation, only fantasy. Paradise only exists where you create it. Those that cannot create it will never experience it. Power underlies all things, and those that have power can gain more of it. The powerless are exactly powerless. Death does not fix anything, only shows that you were not fit to begin with, and your shadow fades into the rumbling foam of history, and those that carry your burden into the future are only weaker because of it. Suicide does not create meaning, it only leaves a void for others to.",/r/depression/comments/69tkq0/pain/

And for every person and for every alias I have a different set of things I can talk about. In person I can talk the least - especially to people where I didn't fuck up the first impression, where I try to uphold the image that I'm a reasonable and stable person. The there are very few people/friends that know I am a bit fucked in the head, which means I can say rude stuff around them and complain about shallow level stuff - like how I'm gonna fail university. Then there's the me on the internet with different accounts. On reddit alone I have six accounts for the different things I want to and can talk about. This one is where I rant about being in a bad mood and the gay stuff - but only the clean gay stuff. Everything else goes somewhere else. Then there's completely anonymous stuff - like omegle, where with every press of the esc button I can pretend to be a different person. Yet still there's a giant amount of things I can't talk about. The moment I'd mention this I'd get so consumed by shame I wouldn't want to continue the conversation with this person, even though I have no name, no trace to my real person. I just don't want to have contact with someone who heard the ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING stuff. This is gonna stay inside my egoistical narcissistic self forever till I or something shuts it down.

That's why ""unloading to someone"", even if I was able to do this at all to someone in person, I'd still try to make an acceptable appearance to the other person, and hiding my true unacceptable self.

The moment I meet someone new I put them in a category of how clean and wrong their view of me is, and if someone, by magic or something got to know every aspect of me I would just cease to function.

I've never really posted on one of these subs before. 
I haven't felt this low in a very long time. I know what's brought it on but I just need someone to talk to to take my mind off of life or rather not living.. 

On Friday I was at a work party and I drank so much that I've blacked out from the last thing I remember is taking a shot to being pulled out of a toilet cubicle covered in my own vomit with my family members having to get me sorted to take me home 2 hours after the bar shut. I fell asleep/passed out in a toilet cubicle and threw up while passed out. I could have died and I don't know if I'm happy I didn't or sad i didn't. If I had I wouldn't have this feeling like I've burdened my whole family and made an embarrassment out of myself. To top things off my family member who has spinal issues is the one who had to burst in and save me. I can't begin to imagine how she did that. To clarify I don't want to kill myself now but I just hate that I put myself in a position that I could have died unintentionally. 

I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety and am on medication for it. But I've not felt this low in 5 years since starting the therapy. 

I know what I did was stupid but I just don't know what to do with myself and I don't know if people reply on here or not but I just feel like shit. It's the only way I can really describe it. ",/r/depression/comments/69tsgo/i_just_need_someone_to_talk_to/

What a happy guy
If only they knew
I wanted to die

They say how are you
But they mean are you over it
The only thing I'm over
Is your lies and bullshit

Because... I'm sick of lying
Tired of trying
I act like a lion
But on the inside I'm dying

I put on a mask
And fill up my glass
I'm willing to tell them
But they never ask

My mouth says yes
But my eyes say no
You can't hurt me
Because I'm already broke

And I'm sick of lying
Tired of crying
I act like a lion
But on the inside I'm dying

I wish on the stars
And on dandelions
That the pain can stop
That I can stop trying

Maybe tomorrow the pain will end
The words will stop hurting
My heart will mend

Maybe tomorrow the pain will stop
The scars will heal
And my guard can drop

I'm in a drought
But we live in an ocean
Hide in my shell
Brush off the emotion

My husband and I have been having difficulties since October. He's gone through a lot of changes (was diagnosed with ADHD and sever chronic depression Jan 2016), and I chalked up a lot of our problems to him just figuring out who he is after getting a double-whammy diagnosis like that. There were also some issues with his best friend - who is a woman. I had/have a lot of jealousy issues with her. Slowly, my husband shut me out of his life, and made her his confidant. But, we were working on these issues, talking them out. At the beginning of this year, we re-committed ourselves to our relationship, saying that we were going to make this year better than last year. Fast-forward four months: husband's job has been very stressful, and we put in an offer on the house of his dreams but the seller chose another buyer. Two weeks after that: he says he is no longer in love with me, doesn't think our marriage is valid because he was depressed when we got married (though he didn't know it at the time), and has been unhappy with our marriage for months.

That revelation was a month ago. I have been devastated. Like, not sleeping, eating, etc. We finally got into marriage counseling a week ago, and the counselor basically just said that my husband needs to decide if he wants to stay in the marriage or not, and then we can begin counseling either towards working on the marriage or working on a separation. I do not want to lose my husband. I love him, and I have given everything to him. But I am so lost, and I have such a small amount of hope left that this can work out, especially since my depressed husband has basically been given all the power to decide our future.

I have finals this week (I'm in grad school.), and I can barely concentrate to write my papers. I feel so alone and abandoned - none of my friends up here know that we've been having issues, though some of his friends know. I don't know what to do. I don't even quite know what I'm posting here for, but if anyone could offer any words of hope or encouragement, I would appreciate it.

I'm hungry but too proud to ask for help, mom made her point clear ""you should get hit by a train cus you'll just end up dying alone"", dad made his point clear when he abandoned us, brother made his point clear when I told him I was a bit under the weather, ""who cares if you die"".  I'm at point in my life where I look down at my blistering hands and look up just to be told I'm lazy. I have no control of the course of this train but I'll aways have the breaks at hand, been told I'm selfish for announcing the existence of the breaks, been called a shitty person because of it, but it does nothing but make me want to stop even more and just quite down all the commotion. I don't know what the point of this post is, I don't know what I'm trying to achieve, cost others grief? Probably, I'm a shitty person after all.",/r/depression/comments/69ujrl/nothing_important/

688,1494199924,elthrowissimo,Seriously questioning my validity as a human being.,"Honestly, sometimes I feel like killing myself would objectively be the right thing to do. Not just because I want to, but also for the good of those around me. I'm 18 and I ""had"" to drop out of high school at 14 because of anxiety (which my doctor refers to as ""social phobia"").

I beat myself up over that a lot. Why wouldn't I? In today's society, that's basically how your worth as a person is calculated. Your job/your degree. How much money you have in your pockets. That's what everything revolves around anyway, money. You either make it, or you're useless. And who am I to complain about this? It mimicks nature in a way, the fittest thrives. 

This is also leading me to question my ""progress"". It feels as if depression, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation have become my personality. As if it's never going to go away. Well, it isn't, I'll just maybe find ways to cope with the symptoms, but it still feels very much part of who I am. And what if I never adjust to life as a ""normal"" person? What if the panic attacks never go away? What if I still feel dwarfed by everybody else around me? What if it's all for nothing? 

Maybe my true problem is the fact that I'm longing so hard to be accepted and validated by others. 

Some of my logic might be flawed, sorry. This post is just a selfish rant anyway.",/r/depression/comments/69uk8e/seriously_questioning_my_validity_as_a_human_being/
689,1494200133,Agentledropoutloser,23 year old college dropout. Previous NEET. Relapsed Stoner. Enabled short manchild. No friends.,"I've already posted most of my depressive episodes on /sw (suicide watch) because I am still suicidal. I am basically a 23 year old university dropout working as a temporary factory worker. My family and I moved to another state when I was 15; I left my closest friends, culture, and happiness behind... 

When i was 20-21 years old, I started to get severely depressed with a lot of things happening at home and at school. Dropped out due to stress, anxiety, and eventually, depression. Tried to get a psychiatrist's help, but the meds she prescribed me gave me horrible anxiety. So i stopped and used the mindset of the ""medicinal"" use of cannabis. I knew I was abusing it though. Subsequently went through a breakup of an almost 3 year relationship with the girl of my dreams during college. Stayed home as a NEET with a weed addiction. My mother hated the fact that I became a stoner, but she was to busy at work to do anything about me being a loser. For a whole year I was unemployed and just stayed home blazing it everyday. I did draw everyday as that was my dream to find a job in the entertainment art industry and to elude my mind from being fixated on missing my ex-girlgriend. 

When I was 22, I found a part time job and saved up to move in an apartment with a so called ""friend"" 8 hrs away from my parents home to pursue an art degree because art was my passion. First time of real independence. Everything was cool until i realized that my roommate whom i met in my previous university was sort of a prick who thinks he's better than everybody. He would always belittle me...My drug addiction caught up to me as i started to hang out with meth tweakers and alcoholics to find some sort of friendship being alone in a new environment. I smoked cannabis even more than ever. Everyday. Going to sleep high, going to school high, doing chores high. I got all A's in my classes and felt like i did something for once, but I broke down when I came back home for the holidays because i told my mom what I was doing and she was scared for me.

I subsequently moved back up home in January 2017. My depression is at its peak up to this point. Went to a crisis ward. Put on 51-50 because of my therapist. Visited my old psychiatrist and went through IOP. Got put on a bunch of meds. Went sober from weed for 4 months. Stayed home, unemployed, and severely depressed. Lost my passion to draw. Stopped eating normally. I went one week only eating 3 meals in total for that whole week. Personal hygiene habits stopped. Stopped brushing. Stopped showering. Stayed in bed. Mom and dad always cooked me meals (but i didnt eat), did my laundry, etc. Waking up everyday was horrible. I didn't want to even be awake. Couldn't get out of my bed. Just stayed at home with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts unless i went to IOP to get myself through therapy. Got diagnosed as bipolar type II. Grandma started verbally abusing my family and I. Eventually she tried to stab my dad and she hit me in the face. This did not help my depression at all.

Eventually went to a temp agency and got a temp job in march. Sort of helped me with eluding my mind from focusing on my depression. Co-workers are nice and my supervisor likes me for my work ethic and heart. Starting to feel like im actually a functioning member of society. Had a relapse with weed for a week due to pressure of going to  nursing school by my mom and my uncle. Now I am on Fluoxetine (Prozac) for an anti-depressant, gabapentin, and lamotrigine. 

Sorry for my stupid story...I just wanted to vent somewhere because I am starting to feel suicidal again. I also wanted to share some of my story to other depressed redditors in hopes of showing that you are not alone. I am also a very worthless human being in my eyes and many others. Do not become like me. If you want a more in depth story about trip through depression, you could check out my /sw post. Again, I just want to let you guys know. You are not alone and you're not worthless like how I am.

690,1494200436,DaniDaniBoBani93,TRIGGER WARNING: I miss my baby.,"I never met her. I don't really even know if it was a her. About a couple months ago, I found out I was ~2ish months pregnant. I had exactly zero support from both the baby's father (a one-time hookup) and my parents, but I wanted to keep her. But then I miscarried, and it sucked really hard.

Only a couple days after, I told my therapist I never wanted to talk about it again, and I thought I would just avoid thinking about it for the rest of my life. Since that time, my depression got a whole lot worse and I spent a week inpatient. It's very hot-and-cold now. But these last few days have been really hard, mainly because now I can't avoid the memories. I've been having lots of dreams about her, like every time I fall asleep. I'm easily triggered, too. I just upgraded my Hulu account because there was a Clearblue pregnancy test commercial that kept playing.

I never wanted to bring it up again because I'm afraid I'd never get over it, I'd never stop crying, I'd never have a sound mind. And, currently, I can't say that I don't feel like it's going to turn out that way.",/r/depression/comments/69ulpl/trigger_warning_i_miss_my_baby/
691,1494200633,saddestthrow,"Coping vs. distracting, how exactly do you get better?","I have no real idea how you're actually supposed to cope with depression. It's a daily, painful struggle that for me has lasted about a decade. You'd think in that time I would have learned some stuff, but I'm not sure I have.

I know how to distract myself from the sadness/pain/irritability/etc., usually. Watch funny videos. Sleep. Watch a movie. Go shopping. But those things only provide a temporary distraction. Once they're over, and sometimes during them, I'm back to being depressed.

But interestingly, my googling of this subject gets me a lot of websites that recommend doing things to distract yourself as a way to get over depression. That can't be right.

These things don't make my depression better. I just don't think of it for a bit. So...how exactly do people get better? I know depression is often a lifelong thing, if it turns out that way for me, I can accept it, as long as it doesn't remain a daily struggle as it has been. I need at least some days where everything doesn't look like hopeless bullshit.

I've been trying medication, still haven't found the right one it seems. But I know even those aren't really magic ""happy pills"" the way a lot of people make them out to be. I've been in therapy, still getting to the root of many issues and if anything, that's making me sadder. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense. I guess I'm just wondering how the hell anyone gets over depression? It seems impossible.",/r/depression/comments/69umab/coping_vs_distracting_how_exactly_do_you_get/
