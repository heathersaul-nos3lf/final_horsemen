0,1583031846,UberGen,Partner's news preoccupation and mania today became a thing...,"Not here to trash my partner, just to vent about how the sheer volume of 'news' on the coronavirus has made a dent in the day.  I agree it's serious, and I'm out getting supplies (partner works from home).  I am looking at the long game in case things are hectic through the summer and we ordered a greenhouse, seeds, and other tools we already had on our 'need 'round the homestead' list.  We had the start of a conversation with the teen and the small about the virus and its impacts around the world, hygiene, etc.  Felt like we were pulling in the same direction, but today I was looking twice at my partner and wondering if I was dealing with the beginnings of a paranoid.

I check the news, but less now because he has a continual stream of headlines and mentions coming in from all over the world about the virus.  Today I moved a piece of mail and he said I needed to stop doing that soon (touching things that are freshly entering the house).  We took the small to her activity and I mentioned where I would get a water test kit (both to quell a previous anxiety point he had, and because it's already on the to-do list 'round the homestead').  And he hissed at me and texted furiously about not mentioning testing kits of any kind in public.  Oh man, my bad.  An hour later I've stopped us for gas and he suggests he'll get out and pump, but then he notices he doesn't have gloves on and I do (it's still chilly here), so never mind I should do it.  On the way home I ask about who he might vote for in the elections and volunteered who I thought was strong.  He instantly made links to candidates' ages and likelihood to survive the virus and he asked me to please wear a mask and gloves to the polls.  We don't have the virus yet in our state, and the polls are at an out-shed type building in a rural area; I'd laugh if there was a line of any kind.

When we got home I broke down, for about 2 hours, and told him this has to chill, it's not healthy to be hooked into every minute, and it's starting to concern me.  I had to underscore that we were on the same page, initially, about preparing, and that I'm very much 'on board', but that he's very much walking the plank and getting way, way out there.   So, yah, I am stressed about the virus and the changes and what it means for lives everywhere, but I have a limited supply of emotional energy, and I just can't take on any more.  Thanks for listening :)",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fbnw9g/partners_news_preoccupation_and_mania_today/

3,1583042161,badskinsxd,An American living in Shanghai's story,"So, I rarely use reddit, but after having seen so many people freaking out and also spreading false/insensitive information that people actually believe, I decided to find a platform where I could show my perspective. 

Some background - I'm an ethnically Chinese, American citizen that goes to an international high school in Shanghai. I moved there from Boston when I was six.

Recently, we were just about to go on our Chinese new year break. I left school not thinking anything would change, however as you all know, I was very wrong. This was around the time that the virus started to spread to the Eastern parts of China, and in compliance with the Shanghai Education Committee's rules, our school and all other schools in Shanghai, international or local had to cancel school until the 17th of February, my end of season basketball tournament along with it. This of course brought uncertainty to my entire community, and these sneaking suspicions of the virus getting even more out of hand soon became true, as the government then ordered that all the schools would be cancelled until some time in March. This ""time"" in March has still not been announced. This caused my whole family to freak out, as different countries started to close their borders to people who have been in China in the last 14 days. Fearing that we would be somehow trapped, my mom told us to pack our bags and booked a last minute flight to Taiwan, and then left our dog in a pet shop to live in until we would hopefully return.

I know that I'm extremely lucky to be able to first of all live in Shanghai and not Hubei, and second, be able to leave the mainland so easily, especially after hearing some extremely depressing stories of families trapped in Hubei. I wasn't the only person to have this idea to leave mainland ASAP, however, many of my friends decided to stay behind, either because it was an extremely inconvenient time to leave, or because their parents didn't think that the virus was that serious. Now, many countries are not allowing them in, so they are basically stuck in Shanghai, but they are still allowed to go outside, however their activities are limited heavily. After a week in Taiwan, we were supposed to go to Singapore, because my mom's work had an office there, however, the day before we were supposed to leave, Singapore announced that effective the next day, they would not let people who were in China mainland in the last 14 days in. Panicking, we again, booked a last minute flight to Singapore and left as early as possible. 

Now, you might be thinking I'm studying of if I'm studying at all (tbh you probably aren't thinking this), and the answer to that is, my school is doing e-learning - posting the assignments online and having us take pictures of our work and send it into the teachers. This certainly is NOT as good as real school, and I know every single one of my friends and classmates can say the same. Education is being greatly affected, especially for the Juniors and Seniors of all schools. Their SATs and ACTs were cancelled, and all AP tests were postponed. While I am not a Junior or Senior, I can completely understand why all of them are panicking; I have a sister who is a Senior right now. 

My family plans to fly back to Shanghai on the 13th of March, however, the situation is still extremely unstable, and we aren't certain that it's the best option, despite my whole family's homesickness and how we all miss my dog. Now, there are a whole lot of insensitive comments coming around, and at this point, I feel like some people are downplaying the effect of the virus. Children are dying. 20-30 y/o adults are dying. People - its not just the ones who are old that are dying, and despite having a lower chance of dying from the virus if you're younger, you do not want to contract it and give it to your family. There are numerous cases where this virus has sadly wiped out entire families in China, and they just aren't being reported to the mainstream media. I urge people to not spread false and insensitive information, because it just causes more panic, however, do not downplay the potential damage that this virus can cause. Wash your hands, protect yourself in public especially if you are in a risky country, and do not be insensitive, as real people are really suffering from this event. 

P.S. my relatives are doing fine. My grandparents were in America long before the virus and are still there. My uncle and his family went to visit them before the virus, and are also still there. 

TLDR: Im an American living in China and school got cancelled as the virus spread. My family, along with many others left mainland ASAP, but not everyone did and now they are stuck in Shanghai. School is now online learning. People are saying this is no big deal, but it's not only old people that are dying. Stay safe. I miss my dog.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fbpu4v/an_american_living_in_shanghais_story/

Between my actual health issues (asthma), my hypochondria/anxiety, and the first confirmed COVID19 case being reported pretty close to me in Oregon, I'm losing my damn mind. I'm also traveling to San Antonio this week for a conference and I'm on the edge of canceling and losing hundreds of dollars out of fear because there's a COVID19 quarantine there and because my flight connects through Seattle and there's thought to be an outbreak in the ""hundreds"" in Washington.

I have a husband. Kids. Parents and in laws over 65. Family and friends who live all over Asia.

I'm not afraid to die but I am terrified of losing any of these people. I'm not worried for my children's health because the virus seems to spare little ones but what if, God forbid, my husband and I get sick? What if they lose their parents, their grandparents? How do I brace my preschoolers for the possibility of 0anything from ""everybody is fine"" to ""every safe adult in your life is gone suddenly and traumatically""? 

What if the virus doesn't touch us but the economy collapses and people start starving? What if we go to war over resource scarcity? These possibilities scare me even more than the virus. Every time we eat dinner together or do some normal family thing I find myself wondering if we are unknowingly going through the last few normal days our family will ever have. 

A few years ago there was a video circulating that shows a goPro style view of a year in the life of a little girl in a war- torn country. It starts with a normal kid birthday and progresses until her next birthday, dirty and hungry and alone in a refugee camp.

I know I'm thinking catastrophically and I recognize the feeling of paranoia from previous bouts of anxiety disorder but I don't know how to sort out what is a probable threat from what is wildly unlikely. A month ago, everyone was telling me it was seriously unlikely that anyone in my family would ever even need to worry about exposure and now I'm watching news come in about positive community spread cases within an hour's travel of my health compromised parents or other immediate family in Tokyo.

8,1583079531,MaggieLulu,"Anxiety is high, just need to vent","Just wanted to write this out because I keep falling down rabbit holes of panic prep and virus gloom and doom and that's not constructive or helpful. I haven't articulated these thoughts yet, so I'm grateful that this sub exists.

Anxiety is currently at about 11 because we're planning to travel next week for a family vacation in Florida. Also planning a day at Disney World during that time. This morning, just got a directive from work that we are to limit travel for in-person meetings and conferences indefinitely, and need to notify management of ANY upcoming air travel. That's fine, I assume I will probably have to work remotely for some time after we return, which is no big deal or disruption to my regular routine. But it makes the situation seem so much more grave, especially with the messaging coming over the weekend. 

I know what you're thinking! u/MaggieLulu, listen to yourself. You're going on vacation in less than a week! Enjoy the beach and family time and soak up that Vitamin D! I'm thinking that too! Believe me, I'm trying very hard to focus on vacation and the good parts of getting out of dodge for a while. We do this trip every year with the fam and it is usually a welcome respite from dreary, snowy midwestern weather and the grind of our jobs and routines, but I keep thinking about how this seems like the exact wrong time in this virus outbreak timeline to do that travel. It seems like the timeline is rapidly accelerating as more cases emerge in the US, so what will things look like when we leave for the airport next Saturday? What will they look like when we come back? 

Don't get me wrong, it will be good to be with my family for sure, but I am so anxious about what-ifs. What if we get stuck in Florida? (I know, that sounds great, but what about our pets, what about our jobs, etc.) What if we get sick? What if my elderly in-laws get sick and I can't help them? I know rationally there is nothing we can do about the spread of this virus beyond hand-washing, being vigilant about cleanliness and personal immunity, but I think about these things and everything just snowballs! I just want to enjoy my time in 75 degree sunshine, dammit!

In reality, I feel we've done all we can to prepare our home for quarantine/illness/supply shortages without going overboard, so we will be fine when we return from vacation. And most importantly, I know that I can't really do anything more besides live my life and enjoy what I can. After all, coronavirus fears aside, there is no way to know what the next weeks, months or years can bring in general. Expect the best, prepare for the worst, right? It's pushing down that nagging interior monologue and just enjoying the present that is causing the most problems for me right now.

Anyway, this is all over the place, I just needed a place to get some thoughts out in a safe space. Thanks for reading!",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fbw9bp/anxiety_is_high_just_need_to_vent/

I am also writing notes to cheer up my future self. 

The gifts include, in no particular order: 
- one of my favorite books, ""The Martian"" (because of its incredibly stoic and deadpan hero, who finds himself all alone on a distant planet)
- a beginner felting set (how to felt cute yellow chicks yay!!🤗)
- a kawaii drawing book (even more cute animals! 🙃)
- a spiritual book by the famous recluse Thomas Merton (learn from the pros)😇
- a beginner sewing kit (how to sew a fun little monster!!) 
- something cool that lets you make UFOs (because why not)
- the book ""How To Survive a Sharknado"" (for obvious reasons)
- a beginner soap stones set
- and very fun and helpful book about how to restart civilization (for the happless time traveller) called ""How To Invent Anything“
- I‘ll also add sudokus and puzzles to the mix!

I have another niece (who thank God doesn't live with us) who had fever yesterday. And no one tested her for covid19, and her damn parents don't listen to me when I told them to take safety messurements like use facemask and wash their hands with frecuency. They call me crazy.

And also our damn president is talking like this is not big deal while others in the goverment said there will me 12 million infected. Also the fact that I'm poor and I have no money to go buy groceries for a week, If the virus doesn't kill me I can die from starvation as well. The fact that the governor of the state I live in, just said that the state is not prepared for a pandemic like this is so scary. My state is one of the poorest in Mexico.

And while I'm typing this I can hear a damn kid in the street coughing while going on the bycicle. Also facemask already sold out in the entire city bc chinese people buyed them all. My mother is diabetic, she will likely die.

19,1583110775,Slyfoxx_,Advice pls,"I will try to make it a long story short. But this is still pretty long.

I went out of town on Feb. 10th and my babysitter watched my kids at my house over night. That night, she had her daughter come to my house to visit her bc she was leaving the next day. Her daughter was visiting from Italy. 

Fast forward to Feb 21, my younger son woke up with a very high fever and cough. He wouldn't eat, threw up twice. That lasted 2-3 days and he is currently fully recovered but still has the wet cough. 

My older son (toddler) had symptoms show on Feb. 26th. Same symptoms as the little one besides the throwing up. He is pretty much better now too besides the cough. 

On Feb. 27th- I woke up with symptoms. It started with a tickle in my thrpat and weird feelimg in my chest the night before. Now I am coughing a lot, my throat feels like it is being torn apart, congestion, headaches, sore body, chest tight ect... NO FEVER. Yellow, thick mucus I will cough up here and there.

They seen the pedi who prescribed antibiotics and steroids and also an antibiotic for me. He did not even test them for the flu or ask about anything really. Just said it was a viral infection and bronchitis caused by the infection.

Anyways.... I am freaking out because I am afraid my babysitters daughter who came from italy could have exposed us to the virus. 
I haven't heard back from the babysitter today when asked a question, i planned on asking how her daughter was doing. I have been trying to think of ways to ask without seeming xenophobic or something, but decided I was just going to ask already. But now no response lol

Even if her daughter was just fine, idk that I would be relieved bc what if she had it and was one of the ones who didn't show symptoms. Or that she could be lying. Any excuse really, i am sure i would make. 

So, i look at my situation and options. My kids seem to be out of the woods for the most part. I am nervous as shit about myself because I am not feeling any better yet, i smoke and ngl, have been drinking the past few days so im able to sleep. Even more nervous for my fiance bc he has been smoking for like 20 years more than me. But luckily he has not been sick yet. 

I live in FL. Idk how i would even go about requesting to be tested, ect... I have us all quarantined, which i would regardless.

28,1583146315,ChrisDobreva,"A journalist in panic isn't a good idea, is it"," Guys, a Bulgarian journalist calling for help here. It's been almost a month since I started reading and researching absolutely on my own news about COVID-19. It wasn't overwhelming at first, not at all. I really deeply thought it was going to follow strictly the outcome with SARS. Now I am constantly digging in medical journals, pharmaceutical issues, clinical trials and again numbers and numbers of the death toll, statistics and you know. First line problem for me is my family's absolute resistance to even hear me. Both my partner and I are journalists, he is a hypochondriac, which, believe me, doesn't help at all. I happen to not be medically educated but have been having a vast interest in medicine for more than a decade now. This does not help either as being familiar with terminology, such as ""ground-glass opacity"" only makes me even more depressed. Second thread of my problem is my own mother, who has many conditions, including those, cited in specific researches to be the most serious and contributing to the CFR rates. Third is the knowledge how the healthcare system here works and how the mentality of the nation will completely (as it is at the time being) downplay the situation when it becomes a situation.

30,1583160737,ryansschultz,Having problems dealing with worry and fear.,"Hi, I am a university science librarian and, back in 2005/2006, an avid H5N1 bird flu prepper, so I have been on top of the Wuhan coronavirus situation since late January when there were only about 1,000 cases in mainland China. I've been busily compiling good, credible, authoritative sources of info about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 to share with family, friends and coworkers, and blogging about it here if you are interested:  [https://ryanschultz.com/category/wuhan-coronavirus/](https://ryanschultz.com/category/wuhan-coronavirus/) (I usually blog about social VR, virtual worlds, and the metaverse, so this is a tangent that has surprised a lot of my readers! I started blogging every day about the coronavirus, got stressed out, realized that I didn't need to blog about it every day, and have cut back to 2-4 posts per week at the moment.)

I am an older person, a significantly overweight person, and a person with several underlying health issues (notably hypertension, asthma, and type II diabetes), which means that I run a significantly higher risk of a severe reaction if I should become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and get COVID-19. As of Feb. 29th, the World Health Organization is now recommending that people that fall into these categories limit their exposure to crowded areas and to people who are already sick: ""If you are 60+, or have an underlying condition like cardiovascular disease, a respiratory condition or diabetes, you have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Try to avoid crowded areas, or places where you might interact with people who are sick."" [https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1233678276096331776](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1233678276096331776) (scroll down to the 5th tweet in the series)

I firmly believe that we will have a full-blown pandemic, and that there will be significant societal disruption as a result, with quarantines, and the implementation of social distancing policies.

So I am stressing out, not continuously, but every so often my anxiety absolutely gets the better of me. I went through my adjustment reaction to a potential pandemic earlier than most people, and I have prepped to the best of my ability, stocking up on food and medications to last me quite a while if I need to self-isolate in my home. But I am still extremely worried that a) I will get this, and b) if I get this, I will die.

I figured this would be the best place to talk about it.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fcd57j/having_problems_dealing_with_worry_and_fear/
31,1583169558,prampsler,Anyone else get frustrated with friends and family in denial?,"I've been gradually preparing for a very challenging springtime for several weeks: quietly planting extra vegetables, stocking up on food, cleaning supplies, etc. It wasn't until the last 7-10 days that I let friends and family know it because I was waiting to see how the situation developed. This week I cancelled a long-planned 12-day trip to Arizona for spring training, a family event, and then a trip to the Midwest to visit family. Despite my imploring them to start preparing, the friends and a significant other associated with these trips have minimized the risk of travel and exposure and tried to ""guilt"" me into going. I'm having none of it, but I'm really quite frustrated and even angry with them because I suspect before long they'll want to mooch off my supplies and potentially infect me.

Anyone else experiencing this? What are your plans for sharing supplies with close friends and SO's who have behaved this way?

32,1583172489,Whispers_of_Eggplant,"My anxiety has never been this bad, and no one is taking me seriously","The virus has affected pretty much every aspect of my life. I dream about epidemics, I cant eat (and trust me, I LOVE food), I'm constantly crying, and I've started shaking constantly, which has never happened before so, yknow, *that's* fun.

I can tell other people all day long that we'll be fine, that things will turn out okay and for now all we can do is be aggressively clean and take immune support, and eat right. But I have a mental block and I'm almost completely unable to convince myself I'm gonna be okay. Last night I woke up twice just to have a panic attack and then go back to sleep.

Like, my grandparents are both in their mid 60s, with my grandma having diabetes. I've been going crazy over the fact that they could die, and I'd be homeless and alone, but honestly, despite them being older they both are fairly healthy. I'm more worried for my grandma since her immune system is weaker and she tends to take more time to heal, but even with that I'm really trying to stay positive. I wish they'd listen to me about prepping and staying at home but of course they wont.

Im worried about me, too. Like, yeah, I'm 20. My immune system holds up two middle fingers to illnesses and I know how to keep myself safe from germs. But I cant get over the fact that there are people who are asymptomatic. What if I'm a carrier and I dont know it? Or if I'm healthy, what if I get the virus? I'm taking information in with a grain of salt, but I've read they're saying it attaches itself to your brain stem, and causes permanent damage to organs. I'm only 20. I havent gotten to live yet, and theres a chance I'll be sickly forever. On top of that, I have irrational embarrassment over being sick. With something like COVID, i feel like my pride and my sense of self would be so insanely damaged were I to catch it, that I may never mentally recover.

And I just started at this amazing job recently, the best job I've ever had. But with the way things are going I'm worried I'm gonna have to quit, both to prevent myself from becoming ill and because my anxiety/depression is making me shut down. Yesterday was a really bad day, especially. Went to the bathroom and cried, zoned out all day, etc etc.

I've been feeling so hopeless and anxious over this scenario, and so powerless. I just want to drop off the face of the earth. I feel trapped and I could use someone to help me rationalize this. I want to know itll be okay, that I'm overreacting. I need my peace of mind back.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fcg5gp/my_anxiety_has_never_been_this_bad_and_no_one_is/

40,1583185834,moonfire098,Immune System Boosting Tea,"I want to preface this by saying that you can boost your immune system by consuming various foods that have essential antioxidants and minerals that play a key role in fighting infections. HOWEVER, increasing immunity does not mean finding a CURE for infections. It just gives your body some additional power to fight infections, but the rest is up to your body. So please dont think that by drinking this tea you will be completely safe from catching anything. **You should continue to exercise all caution such as washing hands extensively, not touching your face, and keeping appropriate distance from others, especially those already sick. And obviously if you're not feeling well, trust your instincts and please go see your doctor!**

Reason I'm sharing this is because in the past I've had a bad immune system and would easily get very sick. I get the flu almost every year even when I take the vaccinations. What I have noticed is that while I still may get sick, the length of the time I stay sick and severity of my bouts have reduced significantly when I regularly drink this tea (2-3 times a day). 

I now try and drink it at least once daily and hope that this recipe may be useful for those who want to give their immune system a little boost. If you start to feel a little sniffle or a slight tickle in your throat, you should definitely start drinking this tea.

I usually make enough for the whole day in the morning and just warm as needed throughout the day or next day:

Serving size, 3:

Take 3 and a half tea cup/glass fulls of water and put in your tea pot (whatever size cup/glass you use to drink tea)

Put the teapot on your stove and turn on the heat

Put the following into the water :
2-3 cloves of Garlic
Half an inch of Ginger nugget sliced
4 cloves
1/3 teaspoon of turmeric 
2 cardamom pods opened 
Honey/maple syrup to taste

Let boil on low for 10-15 mins.

I keep the mixture , without straining in a jug in the fridge and strain out just the water when I want to drink.

Usually I heat it quickly in the microwave or on the stove. It should definitely be consumed warm and not cold from the fridge.

I also add fresh lemon or lime juice at point of drinking, it helps reduce the flavor of the garlic and adds vitamin C to the drink.

You may not have all the ingredients above and not all are required but I would say it is a must to have the ginger, garlic and if possible turmeric at the very least. 

It should also be noted that the garlic can be very strong especially if you dont add lemon juice or any sweeteners. I usually brush my teeth twice and sometimes even have to gargle with mouth wash after drinking this tea. It's worth it for me, but if you have someplace to be, just be cautious of that.

Anyways, I hope this will be useful for some. If you have any other ways you like to boost your immune system or fight infections, please share below!",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fcjowv/immune_system_boosting_tea/

50,1583217653,TERROROFTIANJIN333,"There are so many evidence-based, truthful reasons not to worry","There are so many reasons not to be upset over this that are completely unrelated to the false assertion that this isn't much worse than the flu:

\- You are going to die anyway, so if you are scared of death you should face your thanatophobia head-on rather than directing it into an event which will come to pass. 

\- Epidemics and pandemics have been the norm throughout human history. Disease is a part of human life. If it's impossible to eradicate and sweeps the world in period outbreaks it's really no different from the epidemics of old, it's just found its niche in an age of modern medicine and sanitation. Sure, global supply chains haven't, but with an understanding of germ theory provided you're proactive enough to become self-reliant at least for a half-year period you should be able to ride out the peak of the epidemic. 

\- Antiretrovirals are in the stone age. Where are the antiretrovirals for the four coronaviruses that cause common colds? They don't even exist yet. It's very telling that half of the medicines people are trying on this thing are used for a retrovirus that spreads through needles and anal sex (HIV) instead of coofing. If this thing becomes endemic and repeatedly causes trillions in economic damage there'll be a huge incentive to make specific, effective medicine for it available.

\- Old people in the Western world, especially those born between 1945 and 1965, are whiny, greedy and entitled while accusing everyone else of being the same. They are a massive burden on welfare systems while voting for fiscally conservative politicians that slash welfare for everyone else but them so that government allowances for youth aren't enough to live on, while the elderly soak up as much money as the budgets of several other essential government functions combined on luxurious pension plans from the 1980s. They were given the best point in human history and ruined it for everyone who came after them. When in positions of power they make next to no decisions that benefit anyone in the long term after they're dead because they don't care about their posterity. These people are a cancer and the novel coronavirus is chemotherapy

\- Something is changing. Vladimir Lenin once said that where are decades in which nothing happens, and then there are weeks in which decades happen. I'm not being political, I just think it's a great quote that beautifully describes what's happening. Something is actually happening and it's happening so quickly it's able to sweep across continents at a speed not even news outlets with correspondents everywhere and near-instantaneous communication can keep up with.  The USA's CDC lost track of it almost immediately. This thing is fucking unstoppable and nobody currently ""in control"" can even slow it down enough for it to matter. We're watching history unfold and that's incredibly exciting.

\- When did stagnation ever do anyone any good? Is stagnation of the status-quo forever feasible? When's the last time an event this major that looked like it would shake up the system this hard actually occurred? 2008 was cushioned by governments, 1991 just made the world more boring. The people who form the world's managerial class and have kept the status quo the way it is for decades are the product of a baby boom that occurred after 1945, 75 YEARS AGO. It's been a whole lifetime. Something HAS to happen and it SHOULD.

\- The current system is not sustainable in the long term. Anything that forces it to adapt or die is a good thing. The fact it's not slow like boiling a frog to the point that you yourself, as a mediocrity posting on reddit, are able to see it unfolding in real time just means it's doing a service to you as well as the world.

\- The current system is disgusting in so many ways that there is no solution for its problems that involves working with the system. It needs to be dismantled. Reducing human life to a bunch of rootless people who own nothing and who have no autonomy accumulating interest and engaging in shitty little transactions in a planet-sized marketplace is disgusting. Having to live in it makes you and me more disgusting, not to mention the fact it's all a ponzi scheme and we really don't benefit from it much anyway. It was all a mistake and it shouldn't have been like this. The longer the system lasts, the more pain we'll all feel when it's dismantled. Making the system limp and hopefully trip over when it can't address emerging problems down the road is a GOOD THING. 

\- You need to want to see the system damaged. The system takes everything and melts it down into tacky pozz garbage. If you love or worship anything that isn't Mcdonalds, the IRS, dragon dildoes, decriminalised HIV transmission, factory farming, microplastics in the oceans, an Africa with 4 billion people and UN charter migration flights to Europe, being an infertile dog-mom on type 2 diabetes medication, your own petri dish asshole kept around by AIDs medication, Mammon, Moloch, pornography, marketing departments, rent, single motherhood, usury, student loan debt, stainless steel, the NSA watching you read this through your webcam and concrete, you should want to see cities on fire and mass graves dug in hospital carparks just to prevent this fucking cancer from metastasising further.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fcqo58/there_are_so_many_evidencebased_truthful_reasons/

58,1583264882,queenhadassah,Freaking out,"This is going to be long and disconnected and irrational but I just need a place to ramble, sorry... (potentially triggering)

I keep swinging back and forth between ""it's fine, it's not going to be that bad"" and feeling like I'm completely losing my mind. I've always had paranoia about mainly three things: myself or my loved ones dying suddenly, societal chaos/collapse, and the apocalypse. Now after years of trying to tell myself I'm being irrational, it seems all these fears are coming to life. It doesn't help that the apocalypse one has to do with my paranoia (maybe better termed as a delusion?) that we're living in the biblical end times. I'm not even that religious of a person, but I've never been able to get that out of the back of my head, and things like this bring it right back to the forefront

I've prepped a little bit but we don't have much extra money. And I want to tell my parents (I don't live with them) to prep, but my mom and brother have serious anxiety issues too and I don't want to scare them by emphasizing too much that they should prep. Ugh. I don't know if I can trust my family to self-quarantine if it came down to it, anyway

When I'm super anxious, sensations like touch and loud noises really set me off and make me feel like I'm out of control, so being a SAHM to a 5 month year old (who loves to shriek) is really fucking hard. Obviously I'm still taking good care of him, but it's so hard to distract myself from the real world when he's constantly demanding attention. I am SO thankful though that the virus barely affects children. Him getting sick was one of my biggest fears initially, and I know I would be in a much worse place if I still thought he was vulnerable

My fiancé's job involves going into dozens of other people's home every day, and people around here don't practice very good hygiene. I'm so scared he's going to catch the virus...both for him and me, and also I'm scared he's going to unknowingly spread it to his customers while still asymptomatic (a lot of his customers are elderly and/or sickly). And he can't just not work because we're barely staying afloat financially as it is.

I'm going to visit my parents 8 hours away this weekend and I'm so glad to have the opportunity to see them, but I'm scared to even use the rest stops because of the germs. Being pregnant and having a newborn made me into somewhat of a germophobe, and this is making it soooo much worse. I'm starting to get scared to even get packages because of the virus being potentially spread by the originator or people involved in the shipping. And I'm also so so scared that this could be the last time I see my family (my parents are in their early 60's)

Sometimes I almost wish I'd just get the virus now if it's inevitable anyway and be cured and have immunity before the hospital system becomes completely overloaded. The idea that I or my family members could need ventilation but be unable to get it is terrifying. Especially since I live in a rural area, so the medical care isn't the best in the first place. It's better where my parents live, but there's also a lot more people so more overloaded hospitals...not sure which is worse. I'm so angry the US government seems to be barely doing anything. Us not knowing much about the virus is killing me

I can't go to therapy (wouldn't now because of germs even if I had access to it) and I don't have medication so I don't know what to do. Therapy wouldn't make a difference anyway. I don't someone to tell me how to be less anxious, I want someone to convince me that everything is going to be fine. I just want to scream and cry. Sometimes I hit myself just to let it out. Knowing anxiety lowers immunity makes me even more anxious

59,1583268443,anthonylars,"Live in Santa Clara CA, would moving to a more remote area lessen chance of getting COVID-19?","My logic that likely 2nd to Washington State, it appears that Santa Clara CO, CA will be a cluster / hotbed for COVID-19. I am lucky enough to be flexible (financially, no family ties, etc) to move to a more remote area, and in fact had already considered moving prior to these events. Some areas I'm considering are Montana, Idaho, Rural Indiana, Rural Minnesota, Rural Indiana.

Would moving to a more remote area really lessen the chance of getting COVID? Is the idea that a remote area has possibly less expansive hospital resources a factor here? Is the the idea that eventually the chance of getting COVID while likely less so than Santa Clara CO. CA, would also be present in a real way in these rural areas so moving is not really going to accomplish the goal of NOT getting it or MUCH less likely?

I would also note that I do have a somewhat at risk family member.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fd17pm/live_in_santa_clara_ca_would_moving_to_a_more/

61,1583271210,Whispers_of_Eggplant,The one thing I'm worried about,"I'm about to go full media blackout on COVID19. I realized that hyperanalyzing, reading countless articles and aggressively tracking the virus is literally killing me, and making me sicker than any virus could. Im a mentally unwell person already, but I'm working on my health. And I realized I shouldnt be fucking torturing myself with fearmongering articles and media coverage. I deserve to have peace of mind.

I'm taking solace in the fact that confirmed cases....kinda dont mean anything. If 80% of people experience low/no symptoms, and we didnt close borders with China until *after* reports started picking up, theres probably a good chance it's spread all over now. Who's to say we havent all been exposed?

A couple weeks ago, my grandma had a cough, fever, and was very lethargic and generally felt shitty. It took her about a week to recover, and then my grandpa's caught the same thing, two weeks later, except his wasnt as bad. Neither of them went to the doctor for it. Who's to say it was just a seasonal thing? It wasnt the flu. They could have very well been exposed to COVID at the same time, and my grandma had a shorter incubation period. We'd never know.

I'm taking solace in the fact that we've all likely been exposed, and also the fact that, even if we havent, I'm ramping up my hand washing, sanitizing, etc. I hardly ever go to crowded spaces and my city doesnt have public transportation.

There is one thing, though, that bothers me to no end. I read a couple articles on COVID staying in a person's system. That it can travel to the brain stem and just....stay there. And it causes permanent damage to some organs. And both of those things *terrify* me. Especially the first one. It's making my paranoid brain go crazy. What if theres a ""phase 2"" to the disease we dont know of yet? What if it kills your immune system, like HIV/AIDS? what if it lays dormant, then decides to blow up, like measles encephalitis?

I cant keep reading articles. I'll fall down the rabbit hole, and I dont want to feel helpless again. I want to sort out everything in my mind, sweep the fear and the destructive thoughts away and take this time to be productive, and just go about my day to day with a little more sanitizer and a LOT less worry. And I need help to finally be able to calm down and chill the fuck out about this whole mess.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fd1xmi/the_one_thing_im_worried_about/
62,1583271765,Manaequinn,Glad to have found this Subreddit,"Not sure if I'll get the opportunity to post this, but in any case, I wanted to say that I'm glad I've found this subreddit. I've only recently started updating myself on everything going on with the virus and since that point, it's started to freak me out. I've had about two mini panic attacks over it and for the past 2-3 weeks, I haven't had much of an appetite at all. I've been going about my daily routines as normal for the most part, but if I even hear someone talk about the virus or see an ad or video about it, my body just freezes up and I am just overcome by a sense of dread for hours on end sometimes. The only thing that seems to help keep things off my mind is sleeping (taking naps) or speaking with friends who have all ensured me that things are going to be fine and I just need to stop worrying about it.

I just have so many other things going on as well (outside of worrying about the virus) and I'm supposed to be turning 25 in 2 days which for the first time in my life, I'm not excited about. I've been worrying myself to death about the virus but I just found this sub last night and it's nice to know that I'm not going crazy and that I'm not alone and that there are others feeling the same as me. I know the chances for my age group to catch the virus (or at least get critically ill from it) are slim, but I just can't help but worry about it anyway seeing as there are still so many things we don't know about the virus. Plus, I am still living with my parents due to financial issues and they are in their 50s so naturally, I have to worry about them as well. I like to think things will be fine as I've never been a sickly person and my immune system has been pretty good to me all this time as I rarely get sick from anything at all (nor do I have any underlying medical conditions that I know of.)

It's just been such a huge relief to read what everyone is saying here and trying to put things into a perspective that is more positive than I've been able to do for weeks. I just really hope that things turn out okay for everyone and that this whole ordeal will blow over as soon as possible. I've never been so anxious about something in my entire life.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fd22hn/glad_to_have_found_this_subreddit/
63,1583272881,Wordie,Lots of questions about self-quarantine (in Seattle),"I posted this in the other COVID-19 subreddit, but perhaps this is a better place. I am anxious, but find that information gathering helps with that, and so does Vivaldi. I also anticipate that when I've finished collecting all my supplies and confident that I've covered everything, I'll feel much better.

I've got risk factors and so plan to self-quarantine in Seattle. Just doing that is hard enough, but my situation is further complicated because I don't live in a single family house, but instead a multifamily building. So I have questions:

1. Is it necessary to maintain an *absolute* separation between one’s living space and the outside world? I’ve ordered a CSA foodbox, and planned to disinfect the entire thing (box and food) before bringing it inside. But maybe even that is too risky.
2. What about garbage, recycling and composting? I certainly am not willing to let it build up inside! But I since live in a multi-unit building and other people will also be using the receptacles. So how to I protect myself?
3. What about using the laundry room, which is in the basement and used by all tenants? Luckily, it's a fairly small building and there are no more than a dozen tenants all together, but still...
4. I have a generous balcony and in the warmer months, grow veggies and herbs in containers hung from the railing. But my balcony is contiguous with other people's balconies. So, is this a risk?
5. I already anticipate a couple of times that I will need to leave my home. Will I be completely undermining my efforts?

The advice for those who are doing self-quarantine is essentially to turn one’s home into a sort of hermetically sealed environment, and to not break that seal until the danger is over. Theoretically I'm game, but have so many questions and can't find any advice about how to do this while living in a multi-family building. I'd very much appreciate any info or links people could provide regarding these questions.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fd2cv6/lots_of_questions_about_selfquarantine_in_seattle/
64,1583277837,Lasci_Vious,I am beyond terrified.,"I'm not a huge worrier, by nature, but this situation has me more frightened I could have perceived possible.

I'm 39 and a first-time mom of a 2.5 year old. I have had Type  One diabetes since I was 7 years old. On September 28th I had a heart attack with surgery, and I've been put on medical leave from work until November of this year.

I live in a very small Canadian city with minimal heathcare facilities (even campaigns offering cash bonuses failed to recruit health professionals to our town; the waiting lists for a family physician are years long. I do have one, luckily). Our hospital is bare bones, and we are almost four hours from the nearest large city (I commute every 6-8 weeks to see specialists).

So what is going to happen when this inevitably hits my town? It's not like the fires of two years ago, where I can pick up my life and put it down elsewhere until things are safe enough to return. 

I realize that there is a higher than normal probability that this thing is going to kill me. I'm obviously not a healthy person, and the risk factors are significant - there is absolutely nothing I can do to prevent this. My immune system is for shit.

I don't mean to appropriate anyone else's battle, but the closest feeling I can liken it to is possibly someone who has been diagnosed with mid-stage cancer. I don't know if or when the end is coming - I have no idea how to prepare myself, my husband or my child for something that could be dire af, or a blip on the radar.

On top of that, the people I love are spread out across the country and at risk with advanced age and serious health concerns. I've already had to cancel travel plans to see them, due to their geographical locations having already been hit. We may not have a chance to say goodbye. 

What happens to my son if the people who love him and his backup people are taken? My husband and I are in the process of putting our wills together, but our collective families are tiny. Our son is one of only two grandchildren between both sides, and we each have only one sibling.

I'm blown away and - frankly - incredibly pissed off having read about people casually ""flying back from a trip to Italy (or Iran, or wherever)"" to put people (and lately, entire formerly untouched countries) at risk. How can anyone be so self-absorbed and selfish? You know you have been exposed, but you have things to do, so...eff everybody else. Meh. They can just go die if it means you can sleep in your own bed, tonight.

This is just the worst. I've been waking up at night in cold sweats.

In this post I would like to compile a list of activities, that are pleasent and help you do just that :) Please post below whatever helps you to calm dow, so we can share those things with each other.

I hope this will provide some inspiration to people, who are looking for a way to calm down :)

&amp;#x200B;

Some things that I can recommend to calm down:

\-reminding yourself, that you are not alone and seek out other people, who can help you cope with stress or anxiety

\-taking a hot bath or shower, maybe with a showergel that smells really good to you

\-making your favourite food or baking a cake or cookies

\-cuddling with your pet, or watching videos of cute animals

\-watching your favourite TV series or movie

\-listening to music or singing

\-watching a documentary about something that brings you joy

\-painting a picture, even if you think, you suck at painting, putting some some colorfull swirls on a peace of paper can still be really calming :)

\-go outside to enjoy nature, or (if you are afraid to do that right now, like I am) at least look out the window and look at the clouds or stars for a while",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fdbjc1/pleasent_things_to_occupy_yourself_with/

I’ve been telling my girlfriend and best friend about it for some time now and they keep dismissing it and telling me that I just need to relax and “it’s just not going to be that bad”

I reached my breaking point yesterday morning..
I have a school trip scheduled for today, a trip where 8 other schools in our county will be attending. Roughly 400-500 extra students on top of the 1,000 ish already at the host school. Our district has canceled all “large group gatherings”. Yet after talking with the superintendent directly, he said that he wants me to take them and that it’s not going to be that big of a risk. 
So I could go on forever.. but basically I live alone and 5 hours away from any friend and family.. I’m out here completely alone, in a long distance relationship. Those close to me are literally telling me to “shut the fuck up” and I’m being pressured by my administration to take all my students to this event.

In my town in Belgium, multiple cases of the corona virus are getting detected each day since this week (there is even one person I personally know who is yet to be confirmed with the virus). I'm worried that I can be infected and pass it on my family while going to the gym as I touch a lot of material that plenty of other people touch every day, we all take showers there, touch the lockers, are in close contact with others, etc. 

Even though I try to disinfect my hands before and after the gym, I still manage to put unconsciously my hands to my eyes, mouth, nose,...   

I don't want to stop living in fear locked at home because of this virus, I want to continue to go out and do my activities.

However, I'm worried because I still live with my family and I have very young siblings and my dad works with my grandparents who have a very weak immune system. A regular small cold is almost deadly to them. So I feel like I should lock myself up in my room for weeks/months until this passes to keep everyone safe. 

Am I panicking too much or can I still go out to the gym and don't let fear rule this just because a couple of cases in my town are confirmed with the virus? Certain articles say this is not any worse than a regular flu...

Opinions and advice is appreciated!

I could need some opinions on my situation.,"Hey I'm in my mid 20s living in germany, who has been fighting with anxiety about other things for a little while before this virus. My town and pretty much all places around us have at least 1 confirmed case, germany as a whole has almost 300, it's been exploding over the last couple of days. I'm scared for my grandparents and I might be going crazy, because nobody here seems to be taking it seriously enough.

My brothers workplace have a few people still working there, who had direct contact with the virus, but don't show any illness so far. I've seen people go to shops and other public places while coughing heavily. Schools only close once there has been a confirmed case. Everyone is still going to work as usual, because they don't want to stand out and be the first. People living in the same house as me go about their day pretty much as usual, touching food without washing their hands properly, touching doorknobs and directly afterwards going through their face, rubbing their eyes.

They get annoyed, when I mention these things and tell them to be more careful. They agree with me, but don't actually change their habits. Yesterday my brother touched and ate some food without washing his hands first and when I pointed it out, it took him a little while to even remember that he touched it at all. He just cares so little about it that it just doesn't cross his mind and in my opinion it's putting us all at risk.

So please, can anyone tell me am I just going crazy and I need to calm down? And if not, how can I convince the people around me to be more careful?

93,1583437337,Linxx_0,Lost my motivation because of the virus,"Hello! I’m from Estonia where we have 3 reported cases and the people who felt symptoms or came home from visiting the risk area, went to the doctor themselves and followed every step they had to before even going to the doctor which is good I guess. I am 20 years old and I just had motivation again to get my life together, get a job and maybe even move to the other city and I was so happy mentally and in every way. (I still am but right now I am becoming more worried and that kills my vibe). And then I read the news that the virus started spreading and now it is in my country.. I started thinking that people say it’s just like a regular flu.. but why are people making such a big deal out of this then? I read the news about it just to keep myself updated and not have any false rumors of just false news ruin my mood. I don’t wanna die, I don’t want to catch the virus and just thinking about it makes me feel like “why should i try anymore? the virus just ruined everything and to get back on track takes time”. I have panic attacks and anxiety aswell which I didn’t have for months before I started reading about the virus. People say it’s going to get worse, many people say that it’s getting better now, since the numbers in China are decreasing. Thankfully Estonians are super cautious and have been their whole life even with a norma flu.. when somebody coughs or sneezes then they stay away, so I hope it doesn’t spread here like that.. and I just wanna know it’s all going to be ok but it’s hard.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fe0r6q/lost_my_motivation_because_of_the_virus/
95,1583445182,UncleBigHead,Regarding information to spread fear,"Like many people here, I've had my fair share of scares and anxiety forming from the virus, but in the last few days that fear has slowed down a lot, this because one main thing, I started to pay less attention to the news that are focusing in creating fear to people, like you or me.

One of the best advices I can give you is to stop reading everything on r/worldnews, r/Coronavirus, and so on, where I've been reading everything regarding the coronavirus is in r/COVID19, why? Because that sub is focused on learning from the virus, that has helped me to relax a lot.

I'll give you an example that may have been giving you some anxiety, the discovery of the L and S type of the COVID, the first article that went public was about the discovery in China, and how the L variation (the aggresive one) appeared on 70% of the confirmed cases and started to slow down more and more, which was shocking, but learning that the deadlier one is slowing done can be good, later on the day an article appears on my newsfeed, same thing, I read it but noticed that the last part where the L type wasn't appearing that frequent anymore was cutted, so now one of the important sections of the original article is missing, and the aim of the message can change and fear is easier to spread among people that read the article.

It is important to be informed in times like these, reading studies about the virus can give people that aren't experienced on the area an easy to read and understand summary of things, I encourage you to read this [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fdemjd/we_are_researchers_at_mriglobal_developing/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) that MRI Global did yesterday, a lot of that information come from experts on the field and a research organization being active for 70+ years, their opinion and insights on the manner should be taken more seriously than a journalist that cuts important points in order to scare you.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fe2twu/regarding_information_to_spread_fear/

I'm a New Yorker who isn't in extreme close proximity to NYC, but still close enough where it could affect my home. I've been trying my best to stay calm, but today my anxiety is starting to really peak.

My grandmother just returned home from Florida (where if I'm not mistaken there was a case in Tampa, but if not— absolutely feel free to prove me wrong), and my sister said something to my parents about one of the students at her school coughing a lot and not being able to be sent home because she didn't have anyone to get her. I'm trying my best to stay calm on the outside, but on the inside I feel extremely overwhelmed mentally and emotionally. I'm worried about my family, my friends. Hell, I don't think I'm in the best shape either and I'm terrified of dying (I probably have some undiagnosed form of thanatophobia). And of course that fear sets off my anxiety and that anxiety sets off my fear and it just becomes an horrid cycle of fear and causes me to feel symptoms that for all I know aren't there.

It clouds my judgement and I'm worried it might actually get in the way of knowing god forbid I do get sick. This has happened before and ever since then, I've been terrified of saying anything about it if it is just nothing again. It cost my family money that would have gone to more worthwhile things like rent and bills, and I'm scared of what if something goes wrong. What if I get sick and don't do anything about it?

I have a mild case of GERD but is always mild even when i forget medication, worst case scenario is im sick with acid once in a blue moon. One of my kids was born with a condition that affects physical and mental development. He's had a few seizures in his life which were often sparked by heat provoked by mild chest infections. On top of that, kidney function is not fully 100%.

My father has COPD and is currently in hospital for the next couple of weeks due to abcesses being found on his spine.

My mother who regularly visits him has a heart issue (something to do with an extra valve and body current, i don't know for sure), a condition called M.E and pretty much only has one working kidney. She's a large woman too that despite constantly dieting the past 10-15 years has barely lost any weight possibly due to retention issues.

I was already a highly depressed and anxious individual to begin with long before this. But this has well and truly consumed any joy and hope in my life. Even worse, i almost fell prey to my emotions and attempted suicide not too long ago.

My wife and 14yr old son and 13 yr old daughter were not to fond of this decision. 

I tried to reason with them that not enough tests are being done(until today) to know if your area is infected. Which in my understanding the CDC say to expect more cases. 

At the end of it I changed my mind, I saw my kids starting to worry and decided to just let them go to school. I worry cause my daughter is in flagline and they are having a show followed by family night at the school🤦‍♂️tonight. 

Is it to much for my type of thinking. I mean the anxiety and panic attacks that I'm having as well are not helping, the other day I started coughing and damn near fainted from fear. I just want to be able to protect my family especially if we get it and I know it could have been prevented. 

My fear is rooted around my Dad who is HIV positive for 18yrs now, who has copd and is diabetic. He lives with us,(They are not as educated in the HIV virus as I am. They do have basic understanding of it and know living with him does not mean we will get it.) and I fear this might be one he might not come back from,(he is 58yrsold) being he had 2 other occasions in which they were very close calls.

7,1583492659,CreativeDesignation,Why I decided to leave the house again (Caution: reason is not uplifting),"I have been in my flat for a week now, sitting here with my cat and my monthsworth of supplies. Yesterday evening I decided to go outside again today. The reason is, that I realised ""Nobody is stopping the spread of the virus"", I will simply get it eventuelly. It is kind of a sad reason, but I realised, that since my government remains completly inactive for the most part and most people in my country are stupid enough, to believe the ""It´s just the flu""-bs, nothing will change until thousands of people fall sick. 

It´s also unrealistic for me to stay home until we have a vaccine (best case scenario for that is 6 months, worst case is 18 months) or even a medication. I will simply have to rely on the fact, that I´m still relativly young and mostly healthy.

The number of cases in my country (Germany) increases by about 40-60% every day, most people are beeing send home to self quarantine but it is not enforced in any way and from what I´ve heard, people are not taking it seriously.

One could say, I´m simply giving up on isolating myself. I suspect that we will be ordered to mass isolate in a couple of weeks, since not much is done to slow the spread. Since I do recall some things from math class, I know that, if the current increase of around 50% daily isn´t stopped, we will be looking at 100.000 infections at aroud the 19th of March. 

Until then, I decided to enjoy life again. I will still not shake hands and I will still avoid all crowded places as much as possible, use gloves for things like the atm etc, since I´m not crazy :)

I have been sitting at home for the last couple of days, informing myself and writing various government agencys in my country, aswell as my city. All answes I have gotten were somewhat dismissive.

14,1583541832,iheartmusiclol,For those with health anxiety,"I have severe health anxiety with OCD. Yay!

I did counselling a while back and thought I’d share some tips.

1. Everyone is worried, but some have better self-soothing coping mechanisms. We need to up our game with the self-soothing. 

2. One really important breakthrough in therapy for me was to understand that people can get through illness (even serious) and keep living a fulfilled life. I was in panic-catastrophising-doom mode and my brain wasn’t working properly - I was convinced my life was over...without being ill!

We don’t know enough about the virus yet to know what’s going to happen. We don’t know how it is going to personally affect us and we can’t control that anymore than what we’re already doing. Yes, it could kill us, that is a possibility. But there’s lots of things in life that can kill us and we don’t obsess over them. By continuing to search online, you are trying to control what’s going to happen to you, but you can’t (because you’ve already done all you can). 

3. Stop looking online. You’ve likely prepped in every way possible. You know you will self isolate if you get sick. You know every precaution possible now. Looking at coronavirus subreddits is just carrying on the cycle of your fear and taking you out of whatever you’re doing in the moment. It could even be your mind’s version of escapism - I know it is for me. It’s a way to make my mind obsess and worry over something out of control. But the best coping mechanism is self-soothing. 

4. Identify what makes you feel better and do it as soon as you feel anxious (if you can). Baths, reading, listening to music, reaching out to friends. Take this time as a time to look after yourself and prioritise yourself. Treat yourself as if you’re already unwell (which we are as mental illness is very real) and you need to wind down a bit and do things to make yourself feel better. Learn to believe you deserve to self soothe and you deserve to switch off from scary things. For me, I have a maladaptive belief that if I keep thinking about something constantly, I am keeping myself prepared. Actually what I’m doing is keeping my body in a constant state of anxiety that will make it harder for me to fight a potential infection. Self soothing is a preventative measure! 

And finally...

Here’s an exercise I did in therapy. It makes you challenge your beliefs and rationalise them. 

Belief “if I get seriously ill, people won’t believe me or they’ll be angry”

Evidence for (valid childhood traumas that triggered the health anxiety in the first place):

Other kids thought I was faking it to skip school
People would get annoyed at me cancelling 
Some people got frustrated 
Lost out on jobs and opportunities 
Saw my sister not be believed with her long term health condition and it took her years to be diagnosed

Evidence against:

Took time off work and boss was fine
Kids who got angry with me had their own issues and got angry with a lot of people for other things
I am not responsible for other people’s reactions, nor can I control them 
People’s frustration is often with the health anxiety itself

New belief

“If I get seriously ill, it won’t necessarily make people angry. I can help myself more than I think. I can develop a support network”

I’ll try and do it with coronavirus:

“This is going to cause a global pandemic with serious implications. Im not going to have fun for months, could drag out years. I’m going to lose my job if I have to self isolate. I won’t be able to pay rent. I could die or someone I love could die”

Evidence for:

Bad job 
Higher mortality rate than flu
Countries going into lockdown
Scary stories emerging 
Hospitals won’t be able to cope 
Always get badly ill with respiratory infections

Evidence against:

There will be other jobs. Maybe work from home online jobs will pop up as the economy adapts 
Lower mortality rate than SARS
Most people have mild symptoms 
Landlords will have to accept late payments 
Sensationalist headlines from news outlets that don’t have the full picture yet who generate clicks out of fear 
If I self isolate, I can do that hobby I’ve always wanted to do - play more guitar, write a book, watch every Netflix series. It’s a chance to reevaluate what’s important in my life 
One year of no holidays is nothing compared to all the holidays I’ll go on in the rest of my life 

It is scary, there are no doubts about that. But after coronavirus, there will be something else to be scared about. Before coronavirus, there was world war three in January!

Once I stopped worrying I had cancer, I started worrying I had a brain tumour. You need to tackle the anxiety itself.

Belief “I am going to get ill and die”

Reality “anxiety about potential events I have no control over is ruling and ruining my life right now”

The best thing you can do for yourself right now is treat your anxiety because that’s the biggest threat to you, as it’s stopping you going about your daily life with a healthy mind.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/28/i-have-coronavirus-so-far-it-isnt-that-bad/

But in case of a paywall I thought I'd paste the text for you.

I have the coronavirus. And it hasn’t been that bad.

I am in my late 60s, and the sickest I’ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.

I caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; they’d get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.

As we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired — but who wouldn’t, in our situation? I dozed off.

When I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted to come along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraska’s hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher and wheeled me into a van, which made for a very dramatic scene. I easily could have walked myself, despite my exhaustion.

On the hospital campus, they put me in a biocontainment unit. The space was sealed off, with two double-paned windows that looked out on the hallway, and a large, heavy, insulated door. Two cameras watched me at all times; a set of computer monitors were equipped with microphones, so that the medical staff and I could communicate with CDC officials at central command down the hall. The room had last been used for the Ebola outbreak in 2014.

A doctor and nurses reviewed my case with me and took a bunch of lab tests. They wore heavy-duty hazmat suits sealed with duct tape and equipped with motors that helped with air circulation. It looked like something out of “The Andromeda Strain.” When the test came back a few hours later, I wasn’t surprised to learn that I had the coronavirus. Later, the Tokyo swab confirmed the result — I had caught the virus even before I left the ship.

It didn’t scare me too badly. I knew my number was up. The way I saw it, I was going to get stuck in at least 14 more days of quarantine, even if I didn’t get the virus. So many fellow passengers had come down with the illness, including one of my friends, that I’d gotten somewhat used to the idea that I might catch it, too. My wife, however, tested negative and headed to quarantine at a separate facility a few blocks away. After those days being cooped up on the ship together, I think we both relished the alone time; we still could communicate through our phones.

During the first few days, the hospital staff hooked me up to an IV, mostly as a precaution, and used it to administer magnesium and potassium, just to make sure I had plenty of vitamins. Other than that, my treatment has consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade — and, when my fever rose just above 100 degrees, some ibuprofen. The nurses came to the room every four hours or so, to check my vitals, ask if I needed anything and to draw my blood. I got very good at unhooking all the monitors checking my oxygen level, blood pressure and heart rate so I could go to the bathroom or just pace around the room a little, to get my blood flowing. I never quite got the hang of hooking them back up without making a tangled mess. After 10 days, I moved out of biocontainment and into the same facility as Jeri. Now we can videochat from our separate quarantines, in neighboring rooms.

As of my most recent test, on Thursday, I am still testing positive for the virus. But by now, I don’t require much medical care. The nurses check my temperature twice a day and draw my blood, because I’ve agreed to participate in a clinical study to try to find a treatment for coronavirus. If I test negative three days in a row, then I get to leave.

The time has passed more quickly than I would’ve expected. With my laptop, I get as much work done as I can, remotely. I catch up with friends. I take walks around my room, trying to take a thousand more steps each day. I also watch the news. It’s surreal to see everyone panic — news conferences, the stock market falling, school closures — about a disease I have. It does seem likely that coronavirus will spread in the United States, but it won’t help anybody if we all panic. It’s true that the disease seems much more likely to be fatal for older people and those in poor health. I’m relatively fortunate: I’m still younger than the most at-risk groups, and I’m in good shape, giving me less cause for alarm. Others who contract the virus won’t be as lucky. At least six Diamond Princess passengers have died from the disease, of around 705 passengers who caught it.

Still, coronavirus doesn’t have to be a horrible calamity. Based on my experience, I’d recommend that everyone get a good digital thermometer, just as a comfort tool, so they can reassure themselves if their noses start running.

If you told me when I left home in January that I wouldn’t be back until March — that, instead, I would be confined for more than 24 days because I’d catch a novel virus at the center of what could become a pandemic — that would have completely freaked me out. But now that it’s happening, I’m just taking it one day at a time.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fenuog/article_i_have_the_coronavirus_so_far_it_hasnt/

23,1583568905,Eiks,"""You're fine! You won't have a hard time unless you're elderly, immunocompromised, or have an underlying health condition."" :)","I've heard and read this multiple times since the outbreak of the coronavirus. 

I'm upset at the dismissal of those who may be more susceptible to the virus, as if they're ""less than"", and we're kind of in this ""survival of the fittest"" mentality.

And maybe I only care because it personally affects me too. Last year I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and decided to go with an infusion therapy DMT. It's a heavy hitter, an immunosuppressant that is supposed to stop new lesions by 70 to 90 percent.  

I've been thankful that I haven't gotten any side effects or sick since being on it. Only the sniffles back in January, because I was near a friend who was also sick. I have a pretty tough immune system, and haven't gotten the flu since I was a kid. However when I do get something, it's usually extreme (like the MS).

This past week I've had trouble peeling my eyes away from social media and news articles, feeling my anxiety rise and rise at the numbers and panic.

I felt pretty okay though, as there were no cases confirmed near me until yesterday (I'm in the USA). Now there is one confirmed in my county.

People are my job are kind of joking about it. Saying the, ""It's not a big deal"" bit.

I tried to also be lighthearted about it,  saying how I was carrying Lysol wipes with me all night, and I even carry some in my bag, along with mini Lysol spray.

My coworker said, ""You'll be fine."" 

I try and keep my health stuff private at work because I faced discrimination and fear of losing my job when I was first diagnosed. Plus I'm trying not to make people uncomfortable, or receive pity.

But at that moment I was mentally exhausted of the dismissal of those may be at higher risk, due to no fault of of their own. 

I didn't ask for MS. I don't want it. And now I have to worry about every time someone coughs without covering their mouth. 

I told her, ""I'm immunocomprised, so a bit worried.""

Her eyes widened a little, ""Oh. Well, you have an excuse then!""

It just feels very lonely and isolating in my feelings.

Because I'm still ablebodied, in my twenties, and don't show symptoms, people are going to brush off my anxiety as overreacting.

I just want to not think about this stupid virus and not let the fear control me.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fesazj/youre_fine_you_wont_have_a_hard_time_unless_youre/

26,1583583848,StickyNoodle69,I think I have the virus but there's no testing kits,"I started to get symptoms of pain in the lungs area, restricted breathing, runny nose and sore throat a few days ago. But let me take a step back.  Around early Feb a co-worker got the flu and went to the hospital for pneumonia. She got two other co-workers sick, and I went onto their shift to work overtime. The other two co-workers were working while sick. Brilliant, but they were the only ones who could come in. Fast forward a month later I am now having these symptoms.

Its been about 4 days actually. Sore throat and runny nose have been very minor, they have disappeared. What I'm trying to say, is that I feel well, energetic, I can still taste food, I feel line. But I have these symptoms with the lungs primarily as I described above. Restricted breathing, feels like Im not getting all the air I breathe in, and I feel actual physical aches in the lungs area.  Originally it was just the left lung, but now it's both. I still feel like I can run a few miles.

I just called my local emergency room, they don't have test kits, and they aren't willing to test people unless they have serious symptoms. So I guess I just pretend like everything is fine until my symptoms get worse enough to get tested. And in the mean time I get people sick and endanger people's lives including those who are older and at greater risk.

I need to pay my bills, for me I can not work for probably a couple years honestly. But, I don't want to lose this job, and I am only given an x amount of hours to take off. This is soo stupid, I want to just isolate myself, but then I risk losing my job. But if I do go to work, I endanger the people there especially the older personnel.

I have also been trying to not get so close to people as well.

Hi, my husband and I live with our two cats in a major world capital. We have our own apartment, but it's in a really old building, so I'm worried about the plumbing as I have read that the virus can be transmitted through faulty plumbing or water supply. Also if stuff goes really bad, living in a city with 20 million people who would do alot to get food really scares me as we live in the centre of town.

The alternative option is that we move to our childhood homes back in a touristy beach town. It's way less crowded there, we have a garden with food set up and its alot better of a place if stuff goes completely downhill.

We planned moving at the end of March, but I'm really concerned about lockdowns and the situation going out of hand by then. So far my county has 33 official cases, but I'm highly dubious about that.
We have to wait till the end of March because my husband is doing a diploma required for us to move to Germany, so he doesn't want to stop now when he's close to graduating.

Overall it's just really not good, and while I do know I need to speak to someone regarding the mental health issues I have going on, I haven't had much luck with that helping in the past.  It's at the point where I'm basically non-functional, I can't leave my apartment without having a full-on breakdown and I've been yelling at my dad on the phone for what seems like ever now because I am just freaking out so much and have so much anger and anxiety and everything. 

I guess I'm just looking for any reassurance, commiseration, or advice.  My big concern is my new job starting tomorrow.  They had originally offered for me to start after my trip and I told them I'd like to start earlier, which I now deeply regret.  I really don't think I'm going to be able to keep it under control having to sit in the office when I'm panicking like this and I really don't want to give a bad impression or start off unable to do my work to the best of my ability.  I feel like I have no control over the situation, I feel like by going in I'll be exposing myself to the great possibility of getting sick and will risk my health and my trip.  It stresses me out that so many places are asking people to work from home but as I'll just be starting I don't have that option at all.  I'm doing everything right, washing hands, using sanitizer, avoiding touching my face, but in an office in Manhattan who knows where everyone else has been, and I can't avoid touching everything and interacting with everyone, and I do have to walk through the city to get to work.  I know employers are being a bit more understanding with things due to this virus thing, would it be terrible if I told them that due to my difficulty breathing right now I'm concerned about my risk and would prefer to start in a few weeks?   I've just about had it, I have been nonstop panicking for days now and I've reached a breaking point today.  I've had to take my emergency panic attack medication (it essentially knocks me out) multiple times, and I can't continue living like this for much longer, let alone start a new job when I'm like this.  I need to stay healthy until my breathing issues clear up and until I've gone on my trip and I feel that by going into the office every day I'm majorly risking that.  Any advice or support is so appreciated!

TLDR; live in NYC and am starting new job in Midtown on Monday. Have been having panic attacks at the thought of even leaving my apt let alone going into an office every day and exposing myself to germs there. Have been having breathing difficulties this week and am nervous about what would happen if I was to get the virus on top of them, and I also have thousands invested in a trip in 3 weeks and I really cannot miss it.  Debating on whether it's okay to ask to push my start date back a few weeks so I can get through these breathing issues and my trip but can't decide if this is too drastic or not.  Also just don't know how to cope with this panic, I struggle with anxiety but have never experienced it to this extent before, I am full-on non functional right now",/r/COVID19_support/comments/ffk0vb/corona_panic_surrounding_new_job_and_trip/
46,1583707576,ActualCity,Can't help feeling guilty for something I can't control,"I have a family member who works for a local homeless shelter and we were talking today about what will happen if it reaches the shelter. I'm lucky enough to be young and in good health but I grew up volunteering in this shelter and I know there is going to be a lot of deaths if they have to quarantine and those who rely on them for food might face starvation. 

These people have been nothing but kind and supportive and it's breaking my heart to think that they're going to be extra vulnerable in this situation. I wish I could just take the virus so they don't have to. I don't have the means to donate to them at the moment and I don't think there is anything I can do to help them and it's stuck in my head constantly that they're going to be a vulnerable and probably ignored population in an outbreak. I've tried talking about this with friends and family but it turns into a sort of ""well you'll be fine so don't worry about it"" but it's not something I can just turn off.

I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety mainly because my family may not be able to weather this very well. My mom has a lot of pre-existing conditions including being on immunosuppressants. I have been spending time working on letting go of the things I can't control. I am trying to move beyond worrying about every sniffle and scratchy throat. I'm reminding myself that it is still cold and flu season and with temps increasing and snow melting, seasonal allergies.

I'm just frustrated.  People aren't taking this seriously; they don't even take the flu seriously. I am in charge of cleaning my church campus and last week was absolute hell for me. I feel like I'm not doing enough. At church today, I was hyperaware of people coughing into their hands, touching their faces, not thoroughly washing their hands, using hand sanitizer then wiping it off on their pants.

People are treating this like it's some kind of joke. For my mom, this isn't a joke. I will say the same thing about the flu. For my dad, it isn't a joke because he developed pneumonia after getting the flu. For my friend who attends this church, it isn't a joke because she survived sepsis last year. There are many vulnerable people who attend my church. As for me, well, viral respiratory infections kick my ass.

Even though it may not help, I am planning on putting hand washing reminders by every sink. I wish people understood that loving thy neighbor includes getting needed vaccines, washing your hands, staying home when you're sick. There is nothing holy about going to church sick.

To try to stay sane, I pray and read my Bible. I have been meditating on Psalm 91. In my prayers, I obviously pray for a miracle and protection.

I think it is appropriate here because it will help people panic less and be less anxious if they can make decision such as whether to go to work based on an informed judgement rather than vague fear.]

Do you ever wonder how likely it is that someone at your workplace is infected?  I'm going to show you how to use math to approximate how likely this is.  I'll use two cases to demonstrate the method.  When applying it to your own workplace, don't just change the numbers, you have to understand the math so you can adapt it to your particular situation.

Case 1: Andy works in a city with a population of 1,000,000.  On April 1st, there are 20 symptomatic cases of the virus.  He works in a job where he interacts with 100 new people every day.  What are the odds that he'll interact with someone who has the virus on April 1st?  On April 5th?  On April nth?  When will the probability first surpass 5%?

Answer:

First we'll figure out how many actual cases there are.  Assuming Andy's city is not doing anything to contain the virus or slow the spread, [the number of infected people will double every four days](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#growth-the-doubling-time-of-covid-19-cases).  Let's take our [average incubation period to be 5 days](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#growth-the-doubling-time-of-covid-19-cases).  (Andy can play with these numbers to be more or less careful and see how it affects the answer).  This means that on average, the number of symptomatic cases will be equal to the number of infected people *5 days ago*.  So there were 300 infected people 5 days ago, which means there are 2^(5/4)20 infected people on April 1st, which is about 48.

So far so good.

Now, on April 1st, what are the chances that a given person Andy interacts with will have the virus?  We divide the number of infected people by the population: 49/1,000,000.  The chances that they don't have the virus is 1-48/1,000,000.  The chances that *none* of the 100 people Andy interacts with have the virus is (1-48/1,000,000)^100.  Thus the chances that any of them have the virus is 1-(1-48/1,000,000)^100 = 0.5%.

What about on April 5th?  Now 4 days have passed, so the number of infected people has doubled.  It is now about 96.  We run the same calculation again, to find that the probability that any of the 100 people Andy interacts with has the virus is 1-(1-96/1,000,000)^100 = 1.0%.

On April nth, (n-1) days have passed from April 1st so the probability is 1-(1-2^[(n-1)/4] 48/1,000,000)^100.

To find when it first surpasses 5%, look at desmos: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hpxghaqepg  You can see that this happens on the 14th day, or April 15th.

Case 2: Brenda works in a city with a population of 80,000.  On day 0, there are 10 symptomatic cases.  At her job, she works with the same 50 people every day.  If someone displays symptoms, they are put on mandatory sick leave.  What are the odds that at least one of her coworkers comes to work with the virus on day n, given that none of them have yet been put on sick leave?  How is the probability affected if one of them is put on sick leave?

Answer:

We'll make some simplifying assumptions.  Let's say Brenda works every single day, including weekends.  Also let's say that the incubation period is always exactly 5 days.  Again, you can alter these assumptions to see how much the solution depends on them.

As above, the number of actual cases in Brenda's city can be approximated as 2^(5/4)10=24.

On day n, there are about 2^(n/4)24 actual cases in Brenda's city.  Her coworkers are asymptomatic, which means that if they contracted the virus they contracted it with the last 5 days.  How many people contracted it in the last 5 days?  Well, 5 days ago, 2^((n-5)/4)24 people were infected.  So we can subtract to find how many people contracted the virus in the last n days: 2^(n/4)24 - 2^[(n-5)/4] 24 = 2^(n/4)24 - 2^(n/4)2^(-5/4)*24 = (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24.  The probability that a given coworker didn't contract it in the last 5 days is 1 - (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24/80,000.  Thus the probability that none of her coworkers contracted it in the last 5 days is (1 - (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24/80,000)^50.  So the probability that at least one of them has the virus on day n is 1 - (1 - (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24/80,000)^50.

We calculate some values:

Day 0: 0.87%
Day 1: 1.0%
Day 2: 1.2%
Day 3: 1.5%
Day 4: 1.7%
Day 7: 2.9%
Day 14: 9.4%
Day 21: 28%

Now, if one of Brenda's coworkers is put on sick leave on day n, all her other coworkers could have been infected in the last 5 days at work.  Brenda can estimate how likely this was, based on how careful she thinks her coworkers were being.  Say she estimates that each coworker had a 1% chance of catching the virus from the infected coworker each day.  Then there are 5(days)50(workers)=250 opportunities for the virus to be caught, so the probability that it is caught is 1-(1-0.01)^250 = 92%.  So she can be reasonably confident that someone at work is infected.  Suppose people are way more careful and Brenda estimates the probability that a worker catches the virus on a given day as 0.1%.  Then the probability that someone has the virus on day n is 1-(1-0.001)^250 = 22.1%.

___________________________________________________
The above has been a [Back-of-the-envelope calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation).  The point is not to be completely accurate, but just to get the answer to within an order of magnitude, i.e. probably less than ten times too big or too small.  There were many assumptions made, and they can be modified to get different answers.  I hope this technique is helpful to people.

Some things I didn't account for:

If you're not in South Korea, you probably don't know the number of symptomatic cases.  Rather, you just know the number of confirmed cases.  You'll have to do some approximation for how many confirmed cases you think there are.

If the people you interact with in your job are largely from a certain community, then a symptomatic case in that community contributes way more to the probability of an infected person at your workplace than a symptomatic case elsewhere in the city.

54,1583743380,Illusion13,"I've had zero social life since the first case of coronavirus here in Vancouver in Jan 27, at ""voluntary"" social distancing at the demand of my parents. I don't know how much longer I can take.","This is going to be as much about my unhealthy relationship with my parents/living situation as the actual outbreak itself. I am going to try to not make this political so please don't make it political (think that's not what this subreddit is about anyways).

We are from China, but I've been a Canadian citizen for over 20 years and I actually haven't visited China for over 2 years. I am just over 30 but I am sure many of you would understand that I am still living at home since I am not married. I've actually lived on my own for 3 and a half years when I worked away, but have since moved back in when I transferred back to Vancouver, and never really enjoyed living under my parent's roof. Its very much ""their"" house even though I have joint ownership of it. 

My mom worked in public health in the past and still has friends in that sector. She has WeChat groups with people who are still actively working, so she claims she gets accurate information. Unfortunately from what I can see, the misinformation is just as rampant. She claims that she has never seen an outbreak that warranted a city lock down since shes been born, and that's why it needs to be taken seriously.

I had plans to go out on Jan 27. The evening of Jan 26 was when local misinformation started circulating, and a local city councillor posted rumours of a person who called her saying they were discharged from hospital here, went back to Shanghai, and got diagnosed with coronavirus. Parents panicked, they told me to cancel my plans, don't go to restaurant, public place, etc. I said I am still going to work, how can I even hide from this, and I never thought there's no cases here anyways, but the risk is low so why the heck are you demanding this of me. Nevertheless, the shouting match ended in me canceling my plans and agreeing to stay home. It angered me further when the rumours were false the next day, but Vancouver did announce its real first presumptive case. The beginning of social distancing that day also meant that I watched the Superbowl at home a few days later, instead of going out, having fun. A few days later they furthered the demand to avoid more public places like the gym. 

We had more fights over the next month, I said I'll stay home and appease them, but if there are no local cases for 2 weeks I am ending the madness. Unfortunately, every week here would be one case that trickles in and ruins my count. I'd have more fights about them listening to misinformation, panicking for no reason, not following local guidelines, not trusting local health officials. They'd say I am naïve, don't know how to protect myself, protect my family, etc.

The thing that doesn't make sense is that I go to work full time. I am a pharmacist myself and have peers who are by no means stupid. I see the panic buying that has ransacked our shelves of hand sanitizers, rubbing alcohol, and gloves. We haven't had masks since Jan 20 ish, for some reason that's not been in good supply since the flu season of 2018. I see that if there is an outbreak, there's almost NO way that I can avoid it being in the position that I am in, all I have is my own immune system and the hope that I am one of the 80% mild symptoms. Avoiding restaurants and social outings seems to be a negligible effort to me, and it has killed me emotionally. Meanwhile I am hearing about my friends going out, there are still events going on around to attend, like the 10 year Olympics anniversary, there was a WWE televised event, Wetsuwet protests (HA), none of which I can attend but I see tons of people going, and I am sitting at home after work doing pretty much nothing, and yet somehow that's supposed to protect me when I go to work with NO protective equipment and would be called an idiot for wanting to put on protective equipment. We've also had countless fights about stop trying to hunt for masks, I've read countless sources that they don't work, and finally I found a report on one of the coronavirus subs that say they do.

They claim that nobody is putting chains on me to force me to stay home. I wonder if anyone would even understand the moral chains and guild tripping Asian parents can put on you... 

Its embarrassing when friends joke about it being ""house arrest"". Its embarrassing when people at work ask me what I've been doing my days off and I say ""nothing"". Its embarrassing when I seem to be the nut swimming in misinformation and panic. But I also do know the seriousness of this outbreak, entire provinces and countries even wont be quarantined if it wasn't serious. I am still going to work, healthy, its better than being stuck in a tiny cabin afloat on one of the cruise ships, being refused entry and help from multiple governments around the world.

But it just makes my blood boil wondering wtf I've been doing the last 6 weeks. It makes my blood boil thinking about the last 5 or 6 weeks of my life that I'll never get back way BEFORE the situation here got serious. I have way more scattered thoughts that I don't even know to post in this one message that might still come to mind later. Are my friends who are still going out and having fun the idiots? Or are we the idiot for staying home and freaking out way before the outbreak gets here? I don't even know...

Meanwhile, perhaps its right to do my part to protect the parents (as much as I hate them), and prevent the drama that's sure to ensue if I did catch it, protect the idiots I work with, protect the patients I interact with, etc...

When I first started taking it last year, I was initially worried about getting sick all the time, but in the past year I got ill only once or twice, and it wasn't even horribly prolonged or anything. I am also somewhat ignorant of how these drugs work, but I assume it's only impairing part of my immune system.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been feeling hopeful about covid, but last night I was reading r/Coronavirus articles for a while, and my anxiety just spiraled out of control. I kept reading numbers about how people with compromised immune systems are at risk and death percentages of those people, etc. I also read numbers about how fast it is expected to spread.

How can I support them without being intrusive or coming across like a loon? 

**Example #1:** Friend A is carrying on with her life as usual and is planning an international trip this week to Israel. I felt it wouldn't be OK for me to enable her denial, so I told her that I understand she's been really looking forward to this trip, but has she considered the potential risks in light of current events? Her response was that she thinks she'll be OK due to the fact that she's in good health and in a younger age group (30s). I was shocked by how little research she did on the virus and the situation in Israel, so I just sent her some links to articles regarding the latest travel bans, mandatory quarantines, links to some official travel advice sites and told her that obviously I know it's 100% her decision, but I hope she will take the time to gather some more information &amp; the reason for my concern is that I care for her and don't want her to risk her health or get stuck somewhere for weeks in a quarantine. 

**Example #2:** Friend B is also very merrily carrying on with his life and is totally unaffected by the ongoing outbreak. Note that this person is in his 50s and is very well-educated and well-travelled. He's in good health and is a lecturer at a university but yet again, I was shocked at the level of denial/ignorance when I tried talking to him about the virus. A month ago when I brought it up, he immediately shut me down, wouldn't even let me finish and ""mansplained"" to me how ""the flu is so much worse"". (I rolled my eyes so hard they almost fell out of my head.)

He recently went on a ski trip to Austria and there was no getting through to him when I tried to bring up my concerns again. Today we spoke again and he let me know that since the prices are so low, he's going on another ski trip, this time near the Austrian-Italian border this weekend! I yet again calmly but firmly told him that it's obviously his choice, but I think this is a bad idea and a huge risk. He shrugged it off saying how this is just ""mass hysteria"" and as he's in good health &amp; practices good hygiene, he'll be fine. 

**ARRRRRRRGH.** I've been following developments ever since December and struggle with crippling anxiety by default, so I wasn't surprised when *I* felt unnerved by the first reports out of Wuhan and figured something bad was coming. What helped me was staying informed and trying to understand what we currently know about the virus and see how the world's governments have responded to it so far. 

I am *amazed* (not in a good way) that there are so many people out there who are educated adults, many with families, and are totally OK with being so flippant about the entire thing while I'm sitting at home with my cat and hand sanitizer.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/ffxbx2/my_friends_are_still_in_denial_and_im_so_worried/

On Feb 17th, I came down suddenly with a bad cough, then next day I felt out of it and sick. The day after that I had chills, muscle aches, next day I had a fever and even worse chills. I remember thinking I have not felt this sick since I was a kid. I was cold and dizzy and constantly coughing. It was during this time that the second wave of confirmed cases / deaths in happened in Seattle .

I tried to go back to work the next week, but everyone was talking about coronavirus by this time. I was still coughing and felt kinda dizzy. I decided I'd stay home until my cough went away. A few days later (March 3rd) they told everyone to work from home until the end of March as King County had issued recommendations for everyone to stay home.

I called an urgent care place and told them my symptoms. They said they can't test me because I don't qualify (having symptoms AND knowing someone who tested positive OR had traveled to china recently.) They prescribed me cough suppressant and told me to rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I had a lot of anxiety. Was I going to be okay? Should I avoid all people? Why can't I get tested just to know? What if I get quarantined?

&amp;#x200B;

Their decision not to test me boils down to this:

* There aren't enough tests right now.
* I'm not dying, I'm not particularly at risk (I am in my early 30s).
* There is no cure or treatment. There is no special course of treatment for corona vs the flu.
* A lot more people have it than they can test, so the healthcare system is in a reactive, underprepared mode of action where they are trying to treat the very ill.

&amp;#x200B;

It was pretty demoralizing to feel like I might have the virus that is shutting down businesses and events all over my city and not qualify for testing.

I am convinced I probably have it. This is week 3 for me and the cough is fading and I'm starting to feel less wiped out. Once I get better I will hopefully have some immunity.

 I am trying to avoid social gatherings until my symptoms are completely gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been stressful but I will be okay. I guess the strangest part will not be knowing I had it or not.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/ffy9mq/my_story/

I’m looking for advice because I have had what seems like a cold for the last 5 days but am paranoid that there’s a possibility it was coronavirus and I’m now scared to visit my grandparents. My grandparents raised me and I usually see them a couple weekends a month. I have not seen them in 5 weeks and I am now paranoid that if I do I will give them coronavirus. I am a graduate student and I have a clinical rotation at a public school. It is impossible for me to quarantine for 2 weeks which is what I’d like to do before visiting them. Since it’s impossible I’m constantly paranoid even if my sickness rn is a cold that I will pick up corona asymptomatically through one of the many people I’m around and spread it to them. They are both 75. I’d die if I gave them this stupid virus and I’d die if I lost them. I cry very easily at just the thought. 

I’ve already prepped them $300 worth of groceries and meds/vitamins and told them to stay home as much as possible, which I feel bad about bc they don’t enjoy staying home. I sometimes worry I’m overreacting but I just want to protect them. 

Should I refrain from seeing them? Should I risk it? Should I lay of telling them to resting themselves? How are you handling it with the elderly in your family?

IF the cast continues to tour, IF the theaters are still even open then, would I even feel safe enough to go anywhere with a crowd?

How long until we're restricted from driving around the country?

When will travel be safe again? I really enjoyed cruising, I enjoyed going by airplane, train, or even bus sometimes. I enjoyed seeing other countries and tourist spots.

I've been seeing a lot of similar concerns among posts here and was wondering the possibility of having a FAQ thread where people might be able to access more vague and less personal answers for COVID-19. As I've stated in prior posts I'm not a medical professional but I do have work history in hospitals and have taken a microbiology course that covered a good base on viruses and have had to do research on a prior coronavirus (SARS). 

I by no means intend to provide medical advice as I am just a student but I would like to help provide a break down to the best of my ability of people's concerns as I think a huge problem of the anxiety is that a lot of information isn't broken down for the general public.

I've been finding myself addressing a lot of similar concerns but I do have to go into work/class today so if it's allowed I'd like to open a thread with Q&amp;A so people with similar concerns might be able to find answers in a more timely and organized manner.

I literally feel myself losing it more and more today. It really sucks because I was finally having a few good days after atleast a month of really bad ones. I can’t look at the other Reddit subs without literally feeling like I am going to have a full blown panic attack.

It got to the point that my step father literally stood up from the couch after just sitting down and said he was leaving the room. So now I can’t bring this up with anyone because they’re all pissed at me. My mom is getting her hip replaced on Monday and I’m worried that will be canceled as it’s an “elective procedure” even though the first surgeon messed it up and caused immense pain that won’t go away. And to top it off there are now cases in the counties surrounding mine. 

My real concern is the anxiety, I’ve been on a number of things over the years that haven’t worked and this epidemic is making my anxiety far worse. I just don’t know what to do.

Every day I go to about 5 houses a day to repair appliances. This involves touching some of the dirtiest things in peoples homes. Their refrigerators, washers, dryers, dishwashers, stoves, etc. I get gunk on my clothes, my skin, my face and in my nails. Until recently I've embraced getting dirty is just one of the things that come with my job, sometimes you could just wash off after work and a gross yet fun sign of accomplishment. But now, I go into peoples houses full of nervous energy that makes my customer service skills falter. I'm in Texas, and we're getting more cases each day. I'm only an hour away from San Antonio, which has a lot of people under quarantine and also is a popular city for people to travel in and out of daily for work or leisure. My city is bound to get its first case soon because of this, especially since it's also a popular beach town and it's currently spring break. We get thousands of people coming here to party for the next few weeks.

I have hand sanitizer in my car, which I use after each job, but I feel like it wont be enough since my entire body sometimes becomes contaminated in peoples homes. And trust me, these places can be filthy. Even if the house is squeaky clean, I'm still working on machines where peoples hands go frequently, and sometimes I'm fixing the machine that gets their things clean.

I've tried to bring it up to my boss, and he's a great boss, but he said, ""The chances of you getting it are super low, don't worry about it,"". I'm scared. Not only for myself, but for my customers too. If I happen to get it I wont know for at least 4 to 14 days, and in that time I can spread it to my mostly elderly customers, and that causes me even more anxiety. I don't want to be responsible for hurting other people. I wish I could find some way to convince my boss working isn't worth it for a while. I don't know what it would take. He really likes Trump so I'm hoping someone from the administration says to avoid going out soon because I think even once my city gets our first case he still might not be bothered.

COVID-19 Security Assessment (Small Business, personal contact with clients)

**Virus Facts**

**\*Not comprehensive; the following is collected from public sources, and is subject to frequent change\***

COVID-19 is the disease that is contracted when a person is infected by the coronavirus “SARS-CoV-2”

Experts predict 40% to 70% of the world’s population will be infected by end of 2020

Considered by some experts to be easier to contract than the Flu; the virus is believed to enter the body through the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucus membranes in the body. People are typically infected after touching a contaminated surface then unknowingly introducing the virus into their own body.

Present number of infected persons is 114,952 in 112 countries and is currently trending as increasing with an unknown exponential growth rate. The number of infected persons is widely considered as being under-reported, due to a lack of tests for the virus, poor virus test performance or restrictive testing policies within the regions.

Experts have calculated that approximately 5 % of infected people have required hospital intervention to survive. The likelihood of hospitalization increases with increased age, and when any other health issues are present in the person.

Multiple reports indicate that the virus may be spread without any recognisable symptoms by the carrier. It may be aerosolized which means it is spread into the air by any cough, sneeze or toilet flush containing the virus and air currents within the area may carry the virus to another contamination area but it is unknown exactly how far it may travel. Medical reports indicate a previous COVID-19 infection in China, is believed to have originated from a fellow bus passenger approximately 5 meters away.

Severe Infection by COVID-19 reported to last up to 1 month, some causing death.

Coronaviruses may survive for 4 to 5 days on paper at room temperature, 9 days on other inanimate objects.

Coronaviruses are inactivated within one minute of sodium hypochlorite solution (Commonly sold as commercial bleach, only specific brands use Sodium Hypochlorite within the solution) and hand sanitizer containing 60%- 70% ethanol but the virus remains on the contaminated surface. Common Soap and detergents surround microscopic particles on contact, including coronavirus, so it can be removed from the surface with water and common hygienic cleaning practices.

Voluntary Quarantine of 14 days has been recommended for anyone that has been in contact with an infected person during the window of infection. Reports from China indicate the quarantine period directed by the Chinese government has increased to 28 days, due to numerous accounts of transmission after the 14-day period. Local guidance may increase the recommended quarantine period in the future.

Statistically, everyone should expect to be in quarantine at some point during the course of this virus. There is expected to be at least one other wave of infections, in fall 2020. There is also a very high likelihood of local school, public gathering place, etc. closures in the near future due to containment measures.

Additionally, a UV light sanitizer box can be used to decontaminate cell phones and paperwork if used within the manufacturers’ instructions. Specifically, commercially available, certified UV sterilizers, or UV lights specifically designed for biological decontamination, installed within the manufacturers directions and operated within a container that is sealed from light seepage while in use, because UV sterilizers destroy any living cells, including human tissue.

**COVID-19 Contingencies and Recommendations**

Virus in area

\-Order office sanitizing supplies

\-Heightened sanitizing and microbe consciousness

\-Monitor known community infections

\-Monitor information of possible client infections

\-Ensure staff knowledge of sanitizing procedures and microbe safety

\-Ensure staff knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms

\-Procure office supplies for contingency planning

\-Sanitize parcels/client paperwork before use and ensure frequent hand washing during work

\-Notify clients of new policies, possible changes to business procedures and what to expect if a client is sick/quarantined or if the staff are sick/quarantined

\-Expect reduced productivity from employees, due to decontamination procedures, a greater frequency of psychological distractions and increased anxiety in the workplace

Area in quarantine

\-No travel in the area

\-Work remotely, use of cloud network and home teleconferencing

\-forward office phone to employee

\-Ensure ability for clients to sign documents remotely, (licence online identification verification)

\-Business operations are halted except for business functions that can work remotely or from a home business

\-Expect employees that can work during the quarantine to have extremely reduced productivity

Office Supply Problems

\- Due to the interruption of regular business operations in China, there is a significant and ongoing disruption in the fabrication and export of goods from that country. Because a large percent of goods worldwide depends on Chinese exports; the cost of office supplies is expected to increase and the availability of many goods is expected to be interrupted during the global course of the virus.

\-Stock office supplies in the event of an extended interruption. (Business has been halted for two months in some large cities in China)

Employer Infected

\-Predetermine if office closed or remain open

\-Establish procedures for work flow if employer is unable to work for extended period

\-Quarantine of staff is likely for a minimum of 14 days

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business

Employer household Infected

\-Home quarantine of infected family member is very resource intense and will likely result in household infection to various degrees. Quarantine likely for a minimum of 14 days after the last family member tests negative for the virus.

\-Expect to not work for the duration of the illness’ course through the household.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from employees who are able to work.

\-Detailed decontamination of office is required prior to return of business.

Employee/employee family member sick

\-Global procedure for people in close contact with any person infected with COVID-19, including colleagues, family members and their households, has been to voluntary quarantine for 14 days.

\-Expect employees will not return to work for a minimum of 14 days after a sequence of tests indicating the infected person is no longer infected and no other family members have symptoms of infection.

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from the employees that are able to work.

**Priority items to consider:**

\-UV light sterilizer

\-Office decontamination supplies

\-Set office infection control policy

\-Is Document Drop Box outside the office practical in order to reduce contact with clients

\-Pre-establish Skype/Facetime accounts for staff and client meetings

\-Obtain video conference equipment for staff and familiarize everyone with the functions. Practice operating remotely during regular business operation

\-Determine if a secure office cloud network is appropriate and functional for remote business operations and verify it is working properly

\-Determine the requirements and employ a secure document transport/transfer system, such as a courier, encryption software, or USB security keys to allow for remote inter-business and client mail. Verify that the documents transfer system is functional during regular business operation.

\-Determine the applicability for remote identification verification, in the event that personal signatures are required for business operations during a quarantine. Employ a remote identification verification system that is appropriate to your business operations and will satisfy any local legal requirements.

\- Send and post a newsletter within the office, updating clients and employees of any changes to your business practices.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fgn92e/covid19_small_business_security_assessment/

I suffer from REALLY BAD chronic gastritis and a very bad iron-deficiency anemia. There are doubts I may have thalassemia too, but they cannot test me properly because my blood iron level is so low.

I'm supposed to fly to California tomorrow, and a big part of me wants to cancel. I'm supposed to fly in to SD, meet my long distance girlfriend there and spend about a week driving up the state and staying in the cities, then fly out of SF. All the while, we will be attending concerts. None of them have canceled, all of them are likely to be 1 to 2 thousand people. 

My parents both work in infectious disease, my mom's a nurse and my dad's a doctor. Dad used to work at the CDC for a decade or so, a long time ago. They both think I'll be fine, if I get the virus, so that's comforting. But I've also been following the coronavirus subreddit and it is pure nightmare fuel. I'm 28 and relatively healthy. I *think* I should be fine, but there are so many stories of people who are young who are *not* fine.

I would gladly cancel this trip except for a couple of things. First, my girlfriend will absolutely kill me. She really doesn't think this whole pandemic is a big deal and thinks I'm crazy for even considering canceling, ruining her plans at the last minute. There's also the money. We each dropped about $500 on this trip, nothing is even a little bit refundable, and if I drop out she's going to ask me to pay for her share of it, since she doesn't want to cancel. 

I am generally an anxious person and a bit of a hypochondriac. Nobody around me seems to take the disease even a little bit seriously, meanwhile I am absolutely freaking out. Not just about the trip, but in life in general. I'm stocked up on food and supplies and every time I go to work I have a gut feeling I should just pack it in and stay home.

I don't live with my family or my girlfriend and I recently moved across the country. I have a fair number of friends here but I don't feel that there is anybody I can vent or talk to about this. It's driving me nuts. I don't want to get sick. I don't want pneumonia, I don't want to die, I don't want people around me to die. My dad is 78, has a history of heart problems and high blood pressure and just diagnosed with diabetes. And he insists on working (in a hospital, in infectious disease).

12,1583916567,pteiavn,Math formulas for calculating risk of coming in contact with infected people,"[Cross-posted to [China_Flu](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fgu058/math_formulas_for_calculating_risk_of_contracting/).  I'm trying again since many people didn't get [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ffpcxo/how_to_use_math_to_figure_out_how_likely_it_is/)]

I hope that these formulas will be help people make informed decisions about whether to do things (work, travel, etc.) instead of just acting based on fear.

**1. How to calculate the probability that a random person is infected.**

We define:

N = population of your region (city, state, neighborhood, whatever is appropriate.)
C = number of confirmed cases today
W = wrongness factor: by what factor do you think the number of confirmed cases is wrong due to grossly inadequate testing?  Say there are W times more actual cases than confirmed.  What do you W is in your area?  You can try different values and see how it affects the calculation.
T = doubling time.  How long do you think it takes for the number of cases to double in your region?  The rate for the US as a whole is [2.15 days right now](https://twitter.com/burkert_andreas/status/1237415386959749121).  This will change as we start to put more NPIs (non-pharmacological interventions) into effect.  The rate for the world as a whole, excluding China, is 5 days.  For more doubling rates [see here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#growth-the-doubling-time-of-covid-19-cases).
t = number of days in the future that we are talking about

So pick some values for these things, then...

The probability that a random person in your region is infected n days from now is P = W×2^(t/T)×C/N.

Examples:

New York State, 3 days from today, assume W=10, T=4: P = 10×2^(3/4)×173/19,000,000 = 0.015%
New York State, 10 days from today, assume W=10, T=4: P = 10×2^(10/4)×173/19,000,000 = 0.052%

**2. How to calculate the probability that you will come in contact with an infected person on day t.**

We now define:

P = probability that random person is infected on day n (use section 1)
n = number of people that you will come in contact with (i.e. less than six feet away from) on day t

Now the probability that you will come in contact with at least one infected person on day t is Q = 1-(1-P)^n

Example:

New York State, 3 days from today, assume W=10, T=4.  Assume that you will come in contact with 40 people this day.  Then P=0.015% by section 1, and n=40, so Q = 1-(1- 0.015%)^40 = 0.60%.  So there is a 0.60% chance that you will come in contact with at least one infected person this day.

New York State, 10 days from today, assume W=10, T=4.  Assume that you will come in contact with 40 people this day.  Then Q = 1-(1- 0.052%)^40 = 2.1%.  So there is a 2.1% chance that you will come in contact with at least one infected person this day.

**3. How to calculate the probability that you will come in contact with at least one infected person in a given week**

We define:

Q(d) = probability that you will come in contact with an infected person on day d.  For example, Q(Tue) is the probability that you will come in contact with an infected person on Tuesday.  Use section 2 to calculate this.

Then the probability that you will come in contact with at least one infected person during the week is:

R = 1-(1-Q(Sun))(1-Q(Mon))(1-Q(Tue))(1-Q(Wed))(1-Q(Thu))(1-Q(Fri))(1-Q(Sat))

Example:

Let's talk about NYS again, and assume, as before, that W=10, T=4, n=40 (I am assuming that you come in contact with 40 people every day.  If you come in contact with different numbers of people each day, then you would use a different n for each calculation of Q(d)). Then we tabulate values of Q starting on Sunday (5 days from today (I'm still counting today as Tuesday since the figure of 173 is from Tuesday)).  (I had to use Excel for this.)

Q(Sun) = 0.86%
Q(Mon) = 1.0%
Q(Tue) = 1.2%
Q(Wed) = 1.4%
Q(Thu) = 1.7%
Q(Fri) = 2.0%
Q(Sat) = 2.4%

So the probability that you'll come in contact with an infected person some time this week is

R = 1-(1-0.86%)(1-1.0%)(1-1.2%)(1-1.4%)(1-1.7%)(1-2.0%)(1-2.4%) = 10%

How about the following week?  Then we have:

Q(Sun) = 2.9%
Q(Mon) = 3.4%
Q(Tue) = 4.0%
Q(Wed) = 4.8%
Q(Thu) = 5.7%
Q(Fri) = 6.7%
Q(Sat) = 7.9%

So R = 1-(1-2.9%)(1-3.4%)(1-4.0%)(1-4.8%)(1-5.7%)(1-6.7%)(1-7.9%) = 31%.

Starting to get bad right?  The week after this R = 71%!  And the week after that it's 83%.  This is also near the time that P, the probability that random person is infected, is nearing 1%.

**4. How to calculate the expected value of the number of infected people you will come in contact with during a day.**

OK, so let's say the virus has really advanced and you've given up on avoiding contact with infected people.  How many infected people do you expect to come in contact with on day t?

We use a construct in probability theory called [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value).  Basically, this is what you would get if you went through the day a million times, in a million alternate histories, tabulated the number of infected people you came into contact with in each alternate history, and then took the mean.

We define, as above,

P = probability that a random person is infected on day t
n = number of people you come in contact with on day t

Then, the expected value of the number of infected people you come into contact with is E = n×P.  It's as simple as that!

You also might care about the standard deviation, if you know a bit about probability.  That is sqrt(n×P×(1-P)).

Examples:

New York State, 3 days from today, assume W=10, T=4.  Assume that you will come in contact with 40 people this day.  Then P=0.015% by section 1, and n=40, so E = 40×0.015% = 0.0006.  So you should expect to come in contact with 0.0006 people 3 days from today.  Clearly expected value isn't a very useful measure when P is so low, better to stick to Q (section 2).

Now let's say the virus has really spread and P = 5% (1 out of every 20 people are infected) and you come into contact with 40 people in your day.  Then E = n×P = 40×5% = 2.  So you should expect to come in contact with 2 people this day.  The standard deviation is sqrt(n×P×(1-P)) = 1.38.  Just for fun, we'll also calculate Q = 1-(1-5%)^40 = 87%.  So there's an 87% chance that you will run into at least 1 infected person this day.

**5. How to calculate the expected value of the number of infected people you will come in contact with during a week**

This is easy, just add up the expected values for each day in the week.

**5. Dealing with multiple populations**

Let's say you come in contact with multiple populations, each of which have different Ps (probabilities of being infected).  For example, you might work with homeless people, who have a higher P than non-homeless people.  Or maybe you work in a different place than you live, and the people in each place have different values of P.  How do you adjudicate this in your calculation of Q and E?

Suppose you come in contact with people in populations 1 and 2.  Then we define:

P1 = probability that someone in population 1 is infected
P2 = probability that someone in population 2 is infected
n1 = number of people in population 1 that you come in contact with during the day
n2 = number of people in population 2 that you come in contact with during the day

Now we have:

Q = 1 - (1-P1)^n1×(1-P2)^n2
E = n1*P1 + n2*P2
Standard deviation = sqrt(n1×P1×(1-P1) + n2×P2×(1-P2))

This could also be extended for more than two populations if needed.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fgu3bs/math_formulas_for_calculating_risk_of_coming_in/

So I pretty much spent my night browsing r/coronavirus for news and updates, and as you can guess that didn't exactly ease my fears. 

A lack of sleep would weaken the immune system and that was all I could think about on the ride home. I kept thinking about how I could've caught the corona and it'd be a matter of time until I started showing symptoms. 

(It didn't help there was a really nasty Asian guy a meter away from me at the Starbucks I went to after work, he was sniffing and dry coughing like there was no tomorrow, if he does indeed have the corona there probably won't be one for him, I was so scared and I wished there was some way I could've gotten him removed so he could stop infecting other people).

19,1583936167,TenthKeyDave,Spooked after attending soccer game last Saturday,"First off, let me say that I'm glad this group exists, because I've been bottling a lot of these feelings inside for the past few days, and being able to let them out in a forum where others understand what I'm feeling is a good and necessary thing.

I'm 48 years old, married to an amazing woman who gave birth to our son last October. (We weren't planning on procreating, but we're happy he's here.) I'm in fairly good health and try to eat as healthy as I can, though I am susceptible to cold and flu bugs. I caught the swine flu in 2009, which was a little rough, but I lived through it, and I haven't missed a flu shot since. That said, I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, so ""respiratory virus with no cure or vaccine"" gets to me a bit. 

The first novel coronavirus case in my area was reported last week, and it was reported that the guy who had it had visited the nursing home in Kirkland where it broke out and returned to the area in late February. I tried not to freak out about it and started washing my hands more thoroughly. My son was in the NICU for 2 1/2 weeks, so my wife and I know all about proper thorough hand-washing. 

Here's where my psyche started going downhill. Several of the major hobbies I've developed over the last two decades involve close contact with other people. One of them is sports fandom. I'm a member of my local soccer club's supporters' group. 

Last Saturday, I attended our club's home opener. It was a big tailgate party with a giant grill, lots of food out on tables, and a good-sized group of people close together around a couple of tents. At first, I was happy to see everyone, but then it hit me -- if any one of these people contracted and started incubating the coronavirus without realizing it, it could easily infect *all* of us. Sunlight might be the best disinfectant, but it can only do so much.

I tried my best not to show how spooked I was by that thought. I washed my hands thoroughly before the game, at halftime, and after the game. I also avoided touching my face. For a few points during that 90 minutes, I reminded myself that this might be the only time I get to bang on that bass drum all year, so I better do it like there won't be another game.  

Still, the more I watched everyone chanting and partying, the more spooked I got. I couldn't help but think what might happen if I caught this bug and spread it to my wife and son. Yes, the chances of any of us needing to go to an ICU are low, but I've been on both sides of enough bad beats in Texas Hold 'Em games to know the chance is still there. 

What's more, I started thinking about my parents, both in their 70s, both suffering from various ailments. What happens if I inadvertently bring this virus to their house? Chances are they *won't* survive it, especially if local hospitals get overrun and doctors here have to do what doctors in Italy have done and decide who gets the available treatment. I don't want to be the disease vector that turns my parents into statistics.

Again, I'm taking precautions now. I'm working from home (which I've been doing for years already, so no worries there), washing my hands *a lot*, not touching my face (which makes me feel like I have *the itchiest face known to man*), keeping my phone clean, and not going out unless I have to. That's for me and mine.

Still, our state government is only telling the sick and elderly to avoid going out. Thousands of people are still going to sporting events. The NCAA Tournament is showing no signs of being canceled or played behind closed doors like Italian soccer games. Pro leagues are formulating plans to protect players, but not fans. Lots of my friends are still planning on tailgating and shouting in the stands this coming Saturday, while I'm sitting here quietly hoping the season gets suspended for the sake of everyone's health.

I can't help but think that we're already too late, that something plainly horrible is coming to America in the next 2-3 weeks, and that we as a nation are completely unprepared for the chaos that will ensue. I'm prepared to bunker down for a while if things go pear-shaped, but missing chances to let loose with my fellow supporters is going to be hard as hell -- to say nothing of not being able to go out and travel and do the other things I've always enjoyed doing. I suddenly feel like I've taken things for granted that I shouldn't have, and I can already feel myself turning into a really cranky hermit.

That's my anxiety through all this. Thanks for letting me vent.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fgxtie/spooked_after_attending_soccer_game_last_saturday/

If this is fine with the mods I would update and repost this with all suggestions every week or so, for it to stay visible. I think everyone here can use a bit of positivity :) )

Taking  your mind of things, at least for a while, is really important if you feel stressed out by the current situation. Even if you feel more comfortable, beeing informed all the time, sooner or later you need to relax and do something to recharge your batteries :)

In  this post I would like to compile a list of activities, that are pleasent and help you do just that :) Please post below whatever helps  you to calm down, so we can share those things with each other.

You can suggest really everything, that is relaxing to you, but prefereably  things that everyone (or at least most people) can do, no matter were they are.

I hope this will provide some inspiration to people, who are looking for a way to calm down :)

Some things to calm down:

\-reminding yourself, that you are not alone and seek out other people, who can help you cope with stress or anxiety

\-taking a hot bath or shower, maybe with a showergel that smells really good to you

\-making your favourite food or baking a cake or cookies

\-cuddling with your pet, or watching videos of cute animals

\-watching your favourite TV series or movie

\-listening to music or singing

\-watching a documentary about something that brings you joy

\-painting  a picture, even if you think, you suck at painting, putting some colorfull swirls on a piece of paper can still be really calming :)

\-go  outside to enjoy nature, or (if you are afraid to do that right now,  like I am) at least look out the window and look at the clouds or stars  for a while

\-playing video games, that completly immerse you in another world

\-watching a movie with subtitles, so your brain is busy

\-learning to play an instrument, or perfecting your skill of playing

\-cooking feel-good food that can be frozen (distracting and prepping all in one)

\-online learning, learn a new language or a skill you always wanted to have

\-giving yourself a manicure and/or pedicure or just care for your body in generell

\-turning up your favorite music and dacing to it (or headbanging to it, whatever floats your boat \^\^)

\-reading a book

\-learning to crochet miniatures of your favorite movie/book/game characters

\-watching videos of people making beautiful cakes, it is satisfying and delicious

\-exercise, things like push-ups, sit-ups or yoga, you can do that in your home and don´t need any equipment",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fh2bx5/more_pleasent_things_to_occupy_yourself_with/

I just opened the greatest (or maybe second greatest it is disputed) Spanish daily the El País and on the main Coronavirus News page I read that ""Belgium, Sweden, Ireland, Albania and Hungary have their first victims"" of the coronavirus.  I went to the media sources in one of these (where I am living) and no menion of this ""fact"". No, it is impossible they would just ""forget it"". So I went to the WHO page where the statistics must be correct and it is easy to find each country. None of the above countries have their ""first victim"". I wrote it in a comment to the [elpais.es](https://elpais.es) page but of course no one will see it. But it is interesting. Is it some kind of uncosncious ""national interest"" of the Spanish to create a  seemingly bigger crisis than in reality we do have and create new victims in until now spared areas? (BTW I was sent on a student exchange to Spain - but suddenly our governmen has blocked all the travekóling for students to anywhere because of the virus - so I tried to postpone my date at the booking firm , but they said ""no way"". So obviously in Spain they cannot handle a crisis. Normally it is okay to not let he whims of tourists dctate date-changes and I agree they do not do reinbursments. But postponing is in their interest in such a case as this contagion. These students will have to find another place of course in two or three months.

Is it possible that the current waitress got my buddy sick if it’s been 2 days? And lastly, tomorrow is my last day around him before break.

Unfortunately I live in one of the major epicenters of the outbreak (Westchester). I’m a college student home because we are going virtual at my university.

I’m scared of one of us being the cases that develops pneumonia(in need of ventilators), or worse case ARDS, and would need hospitalization. Given how Italy and China’s pattern, hospitals will be overwhelmed, and many will be infected, especially with the lack of caution.

 who we love, of course, but who is a walking minefield. He and my fiance go back a long, long way and he's a cool dude but he's also just super oblivious. He also has ""I know everything"" syndrome while being one of the simplest minds I know.

Two weeks ago, I watched as he literally sneezed into my fiance's dinner. He has this absent-minded habit of fiddling with anything that's not his. And I literally just heard him open every cabinet in the kitchen even though he owns no food or cooking implements here. My fiance and I are just sitting here like...wtf. I'm 100% positive he hasn't washed his hands except when he takes a shower, and he spends hours at the gym and parties. 

We have had many serious conversations with him about quarantining and how it's important to keep my fiance safe. It is hard for our roommate to remember conversations (legitimate health issue) so we even began writing him reminders every time he comes over. He just thinks he knows better and doesn't follow them. 

Thankfully, he is not around much bc he hangs out w his girlfriend all the time. But she is constantly around sick people and kids and if neither of them have it by this point, I'd be shocked. 

Every time he visits, my fiance and I lock ourselves in our space and wait until he's gone again. Then, we disinfect with soap/water/disinfecting wipes on anything we think he's touched. That, of course, is a crap shoot in a big house or in a shared kitchen. (We don't share a bathroom with him thank god.)

I'm doing everything I can to protect the man dearest to me but I feel like I'm fighting a massive ignorance monster who puts my fiance at risk every day. It's infuriating. I just am hoping we make it to a day where we can stop living in fear

Also, does anyone know if the disease can be spread through the air conditioner? Someone told me that today and I think he's full of shit since they dont really ""recycle"" air and the virus is droplet-motivated. But I definitely want the answer. 

Thanks for letting me vent (pun intended?)!

I'm afraid because my mom needs medicines for blood pressure ttht cant live without and we must go every day to find them on a daily route, we can't stock as dont find that many and they are expensive as well

But I want to isolate us, I'm 40, very overweight with diabetes and blood pressure, my mom had lung problems in the past and is 70, my grandma is 91, we live together.

Now this, how can I isolate us as much as we can?, I purchased antibacterial gel, washable gloves and made homemade masks more for mind relief as I know they are not useful. I plan to buy canned food and got some vitamins, echinaccea and hidroxycloroquin as I read it was used to treat the coronovirus. My plan is to avoid as much going out as we live in a very crowded place and if someone gets fever start taking as many pills as possible, hospitals are not an option here. 

What I'm afraid is to be on the 20% that need assisted breathing, if that happens if first world countries like italy are letting people die as they have not enough intensive care rooms, here it will be chaos as we dont even have water on hospitals, thats why I cannot sleep, what happens if we need assisted breathing, we just die? what will happen also in the rest on the world if most people need it that its available, on Italy they let the elder die the people like me with diabetes die according to ani nterview to a doctor I read few days ago, also a ama on reddit the doctor said that in such cases they will do tought decisions, that means letting the weakest die.

resume: Hospitals are not an option here, and me and two more relatives that live together are in high health risk, I need to find daily pills but want to isolate, don't know how to do that and thats' why I'm very stressed.

She returned on Monday and has been suffering from diarrhea since, and now her husband has it too. She had Monday off and called in sick on Tuesday but came into work today. I asked him why he didn't tell her to stay home and he said she 'insisted' on coming in, which I don't believe in the slightest because he's a compulsive liar and she wouldn't lose benefits/her job if she called in sick for the next week, he'd just have more work to do. Anyway, he kept saying how her symptoms didn't match up to COVID-19, but I told him that diarrhea has been reported as a precursor to the illness in some people (especially in their middle-age, which she is). He then said it was because she drank too much over the weekend, which I tried to point out wasn't likely considering she's had it for 3 days and now her husband has it too. He started screaming at me how it wasn't the coronavirus and how insane I was acting.

I live in Wisconsin, and we are now just starting to get some confirmed cases, but I don't think they are testing anyone here that hasn't been traveling.

I have also been sick the past few days with a really bad cough. It started last friday, got really bad saturday and sunday, then I went to the doctor on monday. They didn't mention anything about traveling, didn't give me a mask to wear, nothing. This felt like a couple years ago when I got bronchitis. I haven't had a fever at all, so I don't think I have covid, but I don't really know. I tried calling my old doctor to just call in the same inhaler prescription I got the last time, but they wouldn't do it without seeing me. That doc stopped taking my insurance, so I had to find a new one, and the new one gave me the inhaler, plus steroids and antibiotics. I haven't taken the steroids or antibiotics because I am afraid of the side affects of the steroids, and I don't think this is bacterial. And besides that, I have been feeling much better since using the inhaler.

I'm so scared, because if this cough isn't covid, what would happen to me if I did get it. I have been a smoker for 20 years and I am overweight. I know I need to get healthy, but this is where I am right now. 

I work from home, so I can stay home for that. I am stocked up to last a month. But, my son goes to public school. I am very, very tempted to just keep him home. There has just been a confirmed case the next county over from me, but I live in the biggest city in the state. I am almost sure it has to already be here, we just don't know it yet. 

What makes it worse, is that I have tried talking to my family about it, and none of them seem to think it's a big deal at all. My mom is in her late 60's and has asthma (lives in a different state,) and my dad is 70 and honestly pretty damn healthy, lives in the county next to mine with the confirmed case. My mom is taking more precautions and at least hand washing and stuff, but my dad just thinks ""oh it's another flu, the news is just fear mongering and blowing things out of proportion."" His sister also just died in California, not covid that I know of, and he is supposed to travel there for the funeral at the end of the month. I have been trying to talk him and my aunt out of going, but so far they are just waiting to see. 

I just want to stay home with my son until we run out of food, and then start worrying about going out. But, I am afraid my family and his school will think I'm nuts for pulling him from school and not leaving the house. Maybe I am, but if we don't just start staying home, it is just going to keep spreading.

My mother has suffered from undiagnosed anxiety for as long as I can remember, but this virus has been her absolute worst nightmare and pushed her over the edge. I understand she wants to “protect her family” (definitely a cultural component to this as well) but my siblings, father, and I have been barred from leaving the house entirely “until further notice” among other measures. My grandmother lives with us which is really worrying her but has been contained to a room away from the rest of us and we all intend to be VERY careful around her.

Thinking about the virus is all my mom does. She has no friends she really speaks to (besides doctors who validate her fears) or any hobbies- all she does is watch/read up on the latest COVID-19 news and worry about the family, resulting in everyday arguments, fits of tears, and extreme amounts of screaming. She’s refusing to get help (especially now since she’s scared of going into any doctors office) and will guilt us as “stressing her out” and making the problems at home worse when we don’t comply or even try to have a discussion with her. Bringing up the word ""therapy"" is enough to tear down the house. She's an extreme skeptic of mental health professionals as well and will often attack what I say as ""what the therapists tell you to do"" or claim they cannot possibly understand her.

Not sure what to do here and how much more of this I can take. Was actually really looking forward to going back to school for the sake of my own independence and sanity (recovering from depression/anxiety myself). Although I do live in a state with a considerable amount of confirmed cases, am I being unreasonable or is complete isolation the only way to protect my grandmother?

She works at a local Amazon plant (thankfully shes wearing a mask, washing hands...etc). So I am nervous about if she would be ok if she got COVID-19.  


My bigger concern is my dad. He is 66. He's had alot of health issues. Every winter he always gets sick and cough, I don't think they ever pinpointed what it was. I do know his immune system is comrpomised. And on top of that he was diagnosed with Leukemia. Can't recall if it was Chronic or Accelerated. He's on meds now and they are split on the line on if this new med is doing much.  


So my obvious questions are should I worry about my wife? And what about my dad? He mostly stays at home, but he does have doctor appointments this week and almost every other week. He also has a pending surgery (on a cancel list).

I grabbed one last batch of goods yesterday after work, I told him that this would be the last go and I'd feel comfortable enough to hunker in for a few weeks and eat through what we have.

67,1584032511,meadowcake,I just need to dump everything out here. This is my personal nightmare and I am at the brink.,"I lost the most important person in my life to a tragic, devastating death recently. Since then, death has become very real to me and I understand that the worst really can happen. The loss shattered me to pieces and just as I was putting myself back together, shit really hit the fan with this pandemic and now I'm mentally preparing myself for the fact that out of the circle of those closest to me, most if not all of them are particularly vulnerable right now. I have loved ones without insurance, others with high risk jobs, others who could have their lives destroyed by the economic and social impact, others with fragile mental health conditions, many others with serious underlying health conditions, one is homeless single mom who is a heavy smoker and the rest are elderly and fragile. I know that at the rate things are going, more likely than not I will be grieving at least one more loss on top of this last one.  I am also one of those types that carries the weight of the world on their shoulders, and my heart is aching for all the people who will be lose their livelihoods, denied emergency care, and all the other myriad ways different groups in all these countries will be devastated in the aftermath of this. It's so fucking hard to watch. 

On top of all this, I am in the process of quitting smoking and having extreme withdrawal symptoms that are crippling my mental health, and I keep relapsing and then feeling guilty that I'm making my lungs more vulnerable. I was put on a medication that due to a misdiagnosis ended up making my anxiety many times worse and am currently withdrawing off that as well. I have had chronic health issues for years due to living in a house infested with histoplasmosis fungus and my parents (including my elderly athsmatic mother) are stuck in that same situation. I am in the process of moving away from home for the first time to another state, a major life transition for me which is stressful enough on its own. Meanwhile I am in the process of negotiating getting my most treasured possessions and my partner's ashes from his unpredictable alcoholic mother who blames me for his death (despite the fact that he was murdered by her husband). 

On top of all this, pandemics have been my #1 phobia since childhood. I suffered severe OCD that would crop up whenever there was even a whiff of a pandemic. I would have panic attacks and nightmares as a kid about it. I'm oddly not a germophobe but my fear of pandemics has been lifelong and bordering on crippling at times. This is literally my worst nightmare come true. This was supposed to be the first year of my life I would really put myself out there, see the country on my own, volunteer, find my tribe, get an education, try new things... and all of that has been snatched away and delayed indefinitely. It's just too much. It's too fucking much. 

I took some time off to get away from it all, only to find out soon after that I was vacationing in a coronavirus confirmed zone. I was doing yoga next to a woman who was so sick and feverish she fell asleep in the middle of the class until she coughed herself awake. I have already possibly been exposed to the virus but can't get tested and I'm self quarantining. I don't feel sorry for myself, I may or may not be ok... I've nearly died a few times and never felt afraid, if I die I die, I believe whatever comes after this is likely better anyway. What I fear instead is suffering. What I fear is loss. What I fear is robbing someone of a hospital bed who needs it more than I do. What I fear is infecting others unknowingly. What I fear is watching the country I love, the only home I know, fall to pieces during a crisis under the reign of a dishonest government who doesn't seem to care about its people.

I am drowning in it all, trapped for now in an apartment where traumatic memories of my dead abusive partner who I love and dearly miss anyway are in every corner. Sleeping without him next to me at night, everything feels so suffocatingly empty. Trapped with nothing but my own thoughts, processing both times I was drugged and raped last year (not by my partner) on top of all this during my drinking binge following my partner's death. Every night I have nightmares about demons possessing me and pulling me around by my chest, and ice cold rain pelting my skin, I wake up gasping for air and shivering, wishing I could just die before I have to lose anything else. I can't tell anyone how I feel because my family is panicking so much already. 

But honestly? I just want this to be over. 2019 was the worst year of my life, and I promised myself that after surviving all of that I'd be strong enough to face anything, and at the start of 2020 I had more hope and was mentally better than I'd ever felt before... only to have that bulldozed immediately by my greatest lifetime fear... it's too much to bear. It's too much. It's just too much for me to handle anymore. I will swallow my fear and face it, but if the aftermath doesn't break me, I will at least wish that it had.

Not only did this Virus completely invade my habits, I was also directly confronted multiple times now in my ""real life"" if you can even call it like that anymore. I happened to be at the wrong GP at the wrong time (I made a post about it if you want to read the full story) where a confirmed patient was sitting in the same waiting room, 2 meters away from me. I was informed by the GP that this was the case and had to get myself tested last friday, it was negative thankfully. Then the sister of my Italian grandmother got infected as she's living close to Milan. She's 85 I believe and has a heart condition, but is apparently just mildly sick and recovering at the moment.

I've never been so depressed before in my life. It's not even that I'm too scared of the virus, I'm young and perfectly healthy apart from some weight issues, I have a immunecomprimised girlfriend but she's off her meds for a month now so she would most likely be fine as well. My parents are in their mid 50s and both physically active and healthy, they both smoke though. No, the reason I'm so depressed is that I cannot think about anything else anymore, read anything else anymore, just can't do anything else than researching anymore.

72,1584041276,NikolaDotMathers,How this is being treated is very discouraging,"As someone from a country that doesn't quite have the strong healthcare system that Italy, Germany, South Korea, and other nations have, this is very discouraging.

Seeing France and the U. K. refuse to test people that aren't in need of hospitalization, then seeing the system that my own country boasts, leaves me very anxious at the prospect of what's to come.

To top it all off, people that went and came back from coronavirus-stricken countries are being less than genuine. For instance, the director of the clinic for skin diseases, even after having had symptoms arise, didn't go for a test, nor did she notify the people with whom she interacted that she'd recently returned from Italy. She went so far as to threaten people that were suspicious, until someone called her in. Now, there are ca. 200 people in isolation because of her.Additionally, in my hometown, there are rumors that a few teachers also came back from Italy while not reporting their departure or subsequent return to the authorities, and going against regulations to quarantine for 2 weeks.

My father had kidney issues a few years back and now has an aching lower back - aged 50 -, and my mother has had IBS for 15 or so years.

If that wasn't enough, my girlfriend currently lives ca. 250 miles away from me, with her parents, grandparent and two younger sisters; while my brother and his sister-in-law live in Germany, with her parents, sister, brother-in-law (my sister-in-law's brother-in-law, yes), and their two children.

I just recently turned 18 and while I understand the mortality rate is incredibly low among my demographic, I have heard that my age range has a higher percentage of severe cases than others. This worries me because (1) obviously the first-hand accounts of survivors have indicated that they suffered through 2+ weeks of absolute hell and misery; and (2) the lasting consequences especially affect the lungs, and physical activity (especially ultrarunning) is my biggest passion outside of academics. If I were to contract and live through a severe case of the virus, I would fall into a deep depression if it impacted my active capacity.

I am taking all the precautions I can--I haven't even gone anywhere out in public for a few days--but I can't control what my siblings and parents are doing. My sisters especially worry me because my older sister works at a dollar store, from which she's brought home a couple of bugs in the past, and my younger sister goes to a large public school (which has thankfully been closed down for three weeks effective March 16th), and the 8th graders are arriving back from their Washington, D.C. trip. This means that my sister will be exposed to potential carriers for at least a day. Besides that, neither of my sisters is taking it as seriously as me.

I haven't been able to concentrate on my school work (which is being conducted virtually until mid-April) for the past three days, when I started to really become concerned about it. The Health Department Director of our state (Ohio) has recently announced that community transmission models indicate ~1% of the state population (117,000 people) could currently carry the virus, and all the confirmed cases are relatively near my home city.

I have a greenhouse and was already planning on enlarging my raised bed garden this year.  We also have a few chickens.  Our little retirement farm, we just love it - easing into new skills, we were both city people.  Well, our little farm just got a whole lot bigger.

The single most important thing I do to reduce my anxiety over the pandemic is to figure out what I'm gonna grow in my garden, where I'm gonna grow it, and getting everything ready to grow it.   I sort through my seed packets and plot almost daily how I'm gonna maximize what I can grow.  I've cleaned out the greenhouse, ordered more seeds, a hydroponic rack for salad stuff, and starter pots (do you know Amazon delivers big bags of potting soil?  the drivers must hate me), and now I'm waiting a couple more weeks for it to warm up enough to plant.

We also were gonna double the size of our chicken flock this year.  Instead, we quadrupled it and ordered 40 baby chicks for next month.  I've already set up the brooder and nursery in a corner of the greenhouse.  In seven months, I'll have 3 or 4 dozen eggs a day, and the extra cockerels to eat.  (And THAT is another learning curve...)

Hey, I know a lot of people don't have much space to grow things in the city, but even a few container pots in the window or a table hydroponic grower can give you a fresh source of greens and herbs pretty quickly.  And growing something you can eat is SO rewarding.  It just feels good to see a little seed transform itself into food under your guidance.

So the way I figure it, we're all spending all of our time just thinking about surviving the next couple months.  Actually, I'm more worried about the people in my neighborhood being frightened and hungry in the aftermath, with no way to get fresh, healthy food to feed their family.  I think that with what I am doing RIGHT NOW I'll be able to help a lot with veggies and eggs later on.

I live in the US in a city with no official cases but only because they aren’t doing any testing. Confirmed cases have traveled through my city and I’m sure there must be community spread.

I have asthma and am currently having a bad flare up, the worst I’ve had in a year or so. It started with chest tightness and shortness of breath last week and now with additional wheezing/coughing. I went to my allergist assuming it was allergies who gave me oral steroids so great now I’m immunocompromised too. I’ve been self isolating as best I can—working from home, ordering groceries, really only have left to go to physical therapy for an injury I’m recovering from.

I’m scared shirtless though. I felt a bit feverish and achey the other day although the thermometer was only 99.5 at highest throughout the day. I don’t know if it’s COVID or just allergies but I wouldn’t be able to get a test because I don’t meet the stupid criteria.

My mind just keeps going in circles. When is it bad enough I go to a doctor or the ER? Should I even go to a doctor? What if I have an asthma attack and need to go to the ER but then get infected by doing so? What if it gets worse overnight but I assumed it was just asthma and then it’s too late? What if they don’t have enough ventilators and oxygen?

Honestly I’ve been on oxygen and close to ventilation before for asthma complications and it is terrifying and I’m freaked out about catching this. To make matters worse I live alone so there’s no body to monitor me or make sure I’m ok.

Basically I’m just freaked out and don’t know what to do about my asthma right now or if it’s even COVID19 but my mind just is going into overdrive and making me feel so anxious and stressed.

My job allowed me today to wfh indefinitely until corona is over and my original return flight is booked in 2 days. My parents are 50+ and are in the high risk range. Also 5% of my time here is arguments with my parents, which is exhausting.

They’re both missing some fun events that had been planned at school and I assume they probably won’t make them up. 

I’m also very worried about what will come after, when school is back and the virus has run it’s course. Will things just go back to normal? Will some aspects of our life be different? Will a lot?

97,1584069802,Gabrock,We are testing the Social Impact of COVID19 on the Halo Effect (trustworthiness x Aesthetic) in Asians and Caucasians,"Hello  people, my name is Giulio and I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the  Nanyang  Technological University (Singapore). Last year I started to   investigate the relationship between the aesthetic of faces (Asians and   Caucasians) and perceived trustworthiness. Our study was preregistered   and approved by the Ethical Review Board of our Institution. Around the   beginning of January, we were half the way through our data collection   stage, but as you all know, COVID-19 started to spread around,  therefore  our original hypothesis is not suitable for testing anymore   (accordingly to our pre-registered plan). On the other hand, we ended up   having standardized values of trustworthiness and aesthetics for a   certain number of human faces (adults and children, males and females,   Asians and Caucasians). Because of this, completing our data collection   will allow us to empirically investigate the social impact of COVID on   faces' perception. We are therefore here to ask for your help, or  better  for 5 minutes of your time. The study is completely anonymous  and the  participation is on a voluntary basis. The final dataset will  be  published for free for other researchers (and curious) to use on the   data repository of the Nanyang Technological University. Results will   help shred the light on how global events, such as COVID, affects   individuals' perceptions and especially the strength of the confirmation   bias effect (more aesthetically pleasing people are also perceived as   more trustworthy). Thanks in advance to all those who decide to help  us!

Today it would be very simple to just share a video, a tweet or a post in reddit or any other social network about your medical conditions and personal insights. When there's such an event we can normally find plenty of ""independent"" testimonies (natural distastes, crimes and so on). Where are those who share daily all their life and thoughts? Don't they even say ""hey, I just went through Covid-19 but don't worry, I'm feeling fine and probably you will"".

Options:

- Everybody who's infected is told not to share any information to prevent panic.

- Nobody wants to share such a painful experience.

- Nobody is actually recovering.

- Nobody was ever told to suffer from Covid-19.

I thought I was doing just fine because i haven't been panicking or feeling helpless about the virus. But it turns out today, I found out I'm completely obsessed. It is all i think about. All I wish to talk about.

I'm in Canada, and for the past week, i've been following closely worlwide how the virus developped.  A few days ago, while most people around me still thought that this virus wasn't going to touch us all that much, that it wasn't a big deal, that it was all going to be just fine. I was following the progression in Europe, how it all turned out. I got as much info as I could on the virus online but did not talk about it much irl because i did not want to seem paranoid.

Today, when the prime minister anounced the new rules and guidelines to avoid spreading the virus, most people around me were either shocked and scared, or were completely dismissive, laughed and thought it was ridiculous. I was calm, I knew it was coming. I had already bought extra toilet paper, canned food, hand sanitizer, etc. I was not surprised at all. But now that people have been talking about it, I found that it is all i do online, but it is also all i do in real life.

I can't stop talking about it, keep arguing with people who are mocking the virus and brushing it off as ""just a regular flu with extra media coverage"" and those who are mocking people who are taking extra precaution (2 people i know who are doing it are fucking nurses for christ sake.), i keep giving information to people who don't know much about it. I keep track even more closely of every new cases diagnosed. I can't seem to take a break from my phone. I read testimonies from people in Italy. When i try to do something else, i keep having the urge to check the news to see if a new case has been diagnosed. I google it, look at every sub. Being away from my phone and information gives me anxiety. 

The only moment i feel ""at peace"" is when i am looking for new infos and when i am reading about the virus. I realize that I am not fine at all because i am ""well informed"", like i thought. I realize that this is just my coping mechanism to deal with the fact that i have no control whatsoever over this situation and that the more i know, the more i feel ""in control"".

104,1584082592,SnowBlossom12,Feeling really freaked out!,"When I came home from work yesterday, my step-dad was talking about preparing a will for himself and my mum. He said it was the coronavirus outbreak which made him think of doing this. They are both in their 70s and have underlying health conditions (mum has high blood pressure &amp; cholesterol and my step-dad is a tobacco smoker so is probably at higher risk). This has made me feel really anxious and upset! The thought of someone in my family getting sick or dying has long been an anxiety trigger for me. 

I work in IT and all of my role could potentially be carried out from home using my company laptop, but so far my employer has only advised people to work from home if they have symptoms of illness (any illness), have recently visited an affected area or have been caring for a relative who has the virus. I don't fit into any of these categories but I'm still concerned that due to the long incubation period many people could be carrying the illness and passing it on without realising it. 

There are currently no confirmed cases here in Norfolk in the UK, but I feel like it's almost inevitable it will arrive here soon. All it takes is one person to go on holiday and bring coronavirus back with them!

Although I'm taking precautions, I'm extra afraid about catching coronavirus and passing it on to my parents and other older relatives. 

Next week, my manager will be returning from a holiday in Spain, which isn't currently on my employer's list of affected areas, although they now have a lot more confirmed cases than the UK. So he will probably be in the office next week as normal, and this is making me feel more anxious!

105,1584083040,eggrights,I tested positive. (Vent),"I've been fevery and coughy for a bit more than a month now, and I got my results back today. I tested positive. 

I'm in highschool (a freshman) still, so I'm a bit worried about what this could mean for my grades. I'm in the middle of taking midterms right now. I missed one today and I have two I'll miss tomorrow (Friday). My state actually shut down schools for 3 weeks (starts Monday), which also raises a bunch of questions. I hope my teachers explain more in the morning. If they do, I'll have a friend tell me what is said.

My parents keep reminding me that I should be fine. Saying things like, ""The people at risk are the elderly and those with weak immune systems."" I'm still worried. I've self-quarantined and my parents don't want me to leave the apartment. I don't want to risk spreading it, so I have no interest in leaving. I think I've already given it to my mom and dad, and I'm terrified of something bad happening to any of us. The last thing I want is to be hospitalized. My family can't afford that right now. We wouldn't be able to pay rent. 

My relatives two states away told us that their grocery stores were nearly completely empty. I'm a bit worried that we might not be able to eat, or we'll have to DoorDash everything to our apartment. Even then, that's expensive and my family doesn't have infinite money. I'm not that worried about (unlikely) death, I'm worried about how my family will be able to support me if it gets worse. I keep hearing the media say that children shouldn't be showing any symptoms, that should just be carriers. I'm showing symptoms though, and a large part of me thinks that that's a bad sign. 

If it gets worse, I honestly don't know what I'll do. I'm a broke kid, so I can't help them pay for anything. I know it's out of my control, but it's a scary thought. I feel worse than I did last week, and last week I felt worse than I did the week before. I don't want it to keep going on that same path. If my parents can't afford rent because I managed to catch it, I wouldn't be able to forgive myself for years. I know it's overdramatic and I'm overreacting.

I'm tired of it, I get angry when someone talks about it, I hate it. and even tho I do, I still look up new info before bed, just like I've been doing since January, a daily update. it's like I'm the only one allowed to know, like no one else is allowed to talk about it in my world. it's crazy what it does to you, and my country is not even largely affected yet.

I've been trying to talk my mom out of making me fly back home for spring break (California, set with coronavirus infections and shutdown schools) and she finally relented yesterday, but came up with a new solution: to drive 12 hours to where I'm studying, pick me up, and drive me home.

The problem here is that I have an absolutely horrible relationship with my father. He is abrasive, hurtful, and emotionally damaging by nature. Just being around him makes me feel like I am in a minefield. I believe he is a good person at heart as the values he stands for are positive and virtuous, but he is the type of person who is willing to throw everything away to teach his kids the virtues he wants to teach – even if it means destroying them emotionally. He knows about how I feel about him and he even took that into account, and decided that destroying his relationship with his child was worth teaching me these values.

I despise him with every ounce of my being. I hate him more than I knew I could hate something. My mother knows about this – she's even taken me to therapy about it before – but she still decided to sign me up for 12 hours crammed in a small car with my dad.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to potentially jeopardize my health and disrupt my life by entering a coronavirus-inhabited area, just for someone who I want out of my life permanently.

The journey to get down there is about 400 miles, and so during the journey I would need to stop and rest at motorway service stations. I would be there for a week, and then make the return journey back up.

However, it seems to me that having to use these service stations - which by definition would be hubs for travellers on mid- to long-range journeys and many, *many* different people pass through these each day - would put me in danger of exposure, and my personal hygiene is... not the best.

I'm terrified that I would contract the disease, not just for myself but for my partner too. However, there are *extremely* limited options for being able to see my partner to the extent that we are often only able to see each other once a year on specific dates. As such, we're both very anxious about being able to spend time with each other.

This is causing me a lot of stress, and I'm torn between wanting to see them and feeling like I need to cancel things and stay in the house. I can't tell if I'm overthinking things or if I'm making this a way bigger thing than it needs to be. I also don't know if this is just going to get worse before it gets better, in which case this might be our only chance for a while.

People do not care here and do not quarantine for 14 days but I did what the government told me (washing hand, not touching face etc...)   The schools in Quebec are going to be closing. Happy that our government is taking the situation VERY seriously and they are starting to test a lot of people  and are shutting down a lot of stuff at 161 cases as I have seen in other countries they waited until 3k people got infected.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fhzryb/update_on_my_anxiety/

Just came accros a [video of people in Siena, Italy, singing together from their balconies](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/fhq000/people_of_siena_italy_sing_a_popular_song_from/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) to encourage each other during the lock down.

I wonder if any of you know any other beautiful, inspiring and uplifting initiatives? Please share them

I'll go first:

* In the Netherlands hashtag ""#coronahulp"" is getting a lot of attention on social media. People offer to do groceries for elderly and others who are at high risks or to drive them (so they don't need to visit the crowded super markets or use public transport, and be able to keep social distance), or to babysit children whose schools are closed.

* I also came across a story of an anonymous donation of face mask to a police station somewhere in Asia, but I can't find the details

Please share your stories of solidarity.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fi13ni/uplifting_initiatives_of_solidarity_in_the_time/

""Its not near as bad as the annual flu season!""

""Everyone prepping are a$$holes!!""

""Maybe you should talk to your doctor about upping your anxiety meds? You're going pretty over board...""

I just want someone to put their hand on my shoulder and say, ""I hear you. I know its stressful. Is there anything in particular you want to talk about?"" Is that too freaking much!?! No. Instead they immediately shut me down.

I have family coming in from out of state next week. We just had our first confirmed case in my city, and there's several near where my family lives. Not to mention their travel plans.

I have a sinking feeling about all of this...I feel sick to my stomach over it all.

I was supposed to stay until Sunday but ended up leaving 3 days early which I was really disappointed about but Trump saying there was a travel ban between Europe and the USA made it seem like we we wouldn’t be let back in the country. Only after we got tickets he clarified that US citizens were exempt from this and would still be let in the country. Our tickets were nonrefundable so we left. 

Anyway according to the CDC website that if you’ve traveled to Europe you should stay home for 14 days. The thing is no one at the airport said anything to us when we got back to the states saying we had to stay home. They knew where we were coming from so why wouldn’t they tell us that?? I mean I feel perfectly fine right now and I’m just confused and don’t really know what to do at this point.

I hope I can think better or feel better when I'm finished, right now I'm just crying as I dont know what will happen.

I take care of my mom who is 68 with bronchitis attacks in the past, my grandma who is 91 and recently had an acv and cannot walk, my wife an I work and Im 40 but morbidy obese with diabetes which put me in risk too, we live together along two pets.

Situation was hard already, now I dont know how to keep them all well, I live in Venezuela and first two cases appeared today, nearby my area.

My wife which is the healthiest is going out to get food as much as we can, and my mom meds she has  blood pressure problems and must take daily meds, but usually we dont find it and must go everyday to many pharmacies to get them, how can I stack medicines? thats my first problem

Second is my grandma, something as trivial as diapers are expensive enough to stack but I wont risk our lives to go out frequently for them, im trying to call a relative outisde to see if he can help me with this

We have no car, taxi is a risk and public transportation is worse, I rreget so much having no car, we are trying to find canned food, doesnt look that hard, maybe can find enough for a month

I got some gloves and antibacterial and everyone who goes out must use them, along with homemade cloth masks for mouth and nose just to avoid us to touch them.

My uncle 70 is also here, as she helps taking care of my grandma, I dont know what to do as I dont have enough to take care of her but if I tell her to go she may not make it I think, very poor person, but if ehs stays she cannot go out, she must choose, Ill ask her what she prefers to do, be on her own or locked here with us but must somehow put money for food.

Pets will eat what we can, no more pet food as its too expensive to stack

Ill try to eat tuna, chicken and stuff like that with no cards to lower my sugar level as I read sugar levels mess up with white cells, I have problem with this

I feel is too much for me, I have to take every decision and its hard to even make them understand that must follow the rules, its old people who not always listen, my stress is thru the roof but today I juts cry, I cannot tell them how I feel to not worry them more but then sometimes I look cranky or angry

hospitals are not an option here, theyu have no water or regular power and if you google venezuela hospital and see the picture, youll understand why they are not an option, if we get it and need ventilador we die.

I live in vienna, austria and my friend who studies in the Netherlands came here for the break (her family lives here) and today we decided to meet up at a park tomorrow. And now, i‘m slowly getting scared of the idea lol. I never thought this would‘ve crossed my mind but when thinking about it, she was in two airports only a few days ago and I‘m kind of reluctant on meeting her. 

In case you don’t know, we currently have about 85 cases in vienna and our government is handling the situation pretty well, this week they started to shut down schools, universities and pretty much everything but supermarkets, pharmacies, banks &amp; posts. And it was adviced to us that we keep our social life at a minimum. 

I don‘t know whether if I am overreacting but everything sort of starts to get into my head and i cant help but get paranoid over this. 

I‘m really sorry that this post is way too long, I guess I just want to know your opinions on whether I should meet up with her or should I cancel our park date. I mean, we will be outdoors, do you think it will be less risky?  

As mentioned, she came here a few days ago and she was gone for many months and I did miss her and need the social interaction but I also am kind of scared at the same time, ugh i just feel like i‘m slowly starting to loose my mind lmao.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fi6z6k/idk_whether_i_should_meet_up_with_my_friends/

I live and work about three hours away from my dad. I live in a busy metro area and confirmed COVID-19 cases are now being declared in county I live in. Since the transplant, I go to my dad’s four days a week (Saturday through Tuesday) and work in the office in the metro area three days a week. I am his only caretaker and the only person who he spends time around - with the exception of a homecare nurse who takes his vitals twice a week.

I’m terrified of my dad catching COVID-19 and losing him. We were so excited and hopeful when he got the kidney transplant. It was great to see him excited and mobile and not exhausted and sleeping all the time.

What should I expect/how should I prepare?,"Seeing lots of talk about how countries/governments are planning to handle this Coronavirus outbreak and how to *avoid* contracting it but not much on best practices for weathering the storm if/when people DO contract it, so any advice would be appreciated.

A bit about my situation: I'm 35, reasonably healthy, just moved to the USA and only just got basic health insurance via my part-time job (which I started about 2 months ago after finally getting a work permit but is currently unable to offer me hours due to it being in the events industry and lots of events cancelling).

If (or is it more like when) I contract the virus, should I be expected to self-quarantine in my home and just endure the symptoms as if it was a bad flu for however long it takes for my body to fight it? Should I just administer the same self-care as I would for any flu-like illness? And at what point should I seek medical assistance if symptoms worsen? Are there any specific preparations I can make now in case of quarantine?

Also, should I be worried about the potential costs going to a doctor/hospital without fully understanding the US healthcare/insurance system or will COVID-19 tests/treatments be financially covered by the US government? As I mentioned, I just signed up for health insruance through my part-time job but I don't know how it works in the US/whether I have to go to a specific healthcare provider etc.... 

Feels like there's lots of people saying ""wash your hands a lot"" but not many people saying ""here's how to survive it if you get it"" or ""here's how bad it's going to get before it gets better"".....

*While   rubbing alcohol naturally kills bacteria and  viruses, Dr. Andrew   Alexis, MD, chair of Mount Sinai West's department  of dermatology, says   he does not recommend using it to disinfect your  home. “While  commonly  used to disinfect smaller objects such as  stethoscopes,  rubber  stoppers of medication vials, and thermometers,  alcohol  solutions are  extremely evaporative and therefore not an  effective  means of  decontaminating household surfaces,” he explains.*

*He says* ***items really need to be submerged in isopropyl alcohol for 10 minutes in order for it to really do its thing***\*,    but since the alcohol concentration is so high, it evaporates just  too   darn fast to really be effective for the sanitization of  surfaces.\*",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fiagmo/does_wiping_things_down_with_rubbing_alcohol/

If you see that in passing it will scare the SHIT out of you, but only if you really read it, and it's source will you discover it's based on research with a sample size of 20 of only the worst cases (and no concessions on if you may heal).

&amp;#x200B;

Another big offender is the reddit community. For example /r/coronavirus now has almost A MILLION users (at the time of writing). With a group that big there is almost no filter on what a user can spew. I have seen people making claims about shit like ""My brother works for a finance company and they said we will need to switch to a gold economy after this"", ""10 million deaths is a gross and negligent underestimate, it will be 25 million"", and people literally claiming it's the end of humanity unironically. I have seen so many people make claims that world renown researchers and scientist are WRONG and they are RIGHT it makes my head spin.

  
The other issue with these communities is that ANYTHING remotely positive, or even mildly optimistic is immediately stamped out. If you post an article about how a very credentialed researcher thinks it may be ever so slightly less bad than ""we are fucked"" you will get called dangerous and downvoted out of existence. Some of these people do truly believe the this is the end, other are trolling, some are fantasizing, and other get off on the fear. There is almost no positivity allowed on many of these communities. If you find yourself having anxiety over Corona these are not places you should frequent

&amp;#x200B;

No amount of reading about bad things happening around the world is going to help you if you are already doing what is being asked of you as a citizen. If you are conforming to what the WHO/CDC ect are asking you to do there is nothing to gain by reading about horrible things happening elsewhere.

**So What Am I Proposing**

If you find yourself struggling with anxiety over corona, or the news it is time to lower your exposure to it.

\-Do what you need to be doing right now (stocking a few weeks of food/hygiene products/medicines,practicing social distancing whenever possible, washing your hands, coughing/sneezing into your elbow, keeping an eye on symptoms, ect). Look for CDC/WHO guidelines on what you should be doing.  
\-Wait and read any updates that come from Government/World Agencies (The CDC, WHO, The President, ect)  
\-Follow your country/state/local authorities on twitter, or find their website that official updates are released on and follow it.  
\-Otherwise do whatever you need to survive remembering to try and eat well, sleep well, and try and exercise.  
\-If you feel up to it check in on the news, but remember to have a discerning eye for sensationalism and bad articles

I traveled a couple weeks ago to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, which is now thought to have been a vector of community spread leading to cases in several states. I had a mild sinus infection when I went, but after I returned home, it turned into a bitch of a cough that took me down for a week. I monitored my temperature, which stayed within roughly normal parameters. I had no other symptoms -- just generally tired and a bit achey, but of course you are when you're hacking all day.

I thought at the time I had just overexerted myself (I wasn't gonna take a 16-hour road trip just to stay in my room when I got there!) and made myself worse, but now hearing this news, I am suspicious of COVID-19.

My friend that I went with has been ok, but had a mild cold when he got back.

But I'm not sure if that's meaningful. He's 25 and I'm 30. Few or no symptoms are common in our age range.

The thing is, I'm not in any danger. I'm nearly recovered at this point, and was never ill enough to have considered going to the hospital or anything.

But I'm worried for my loved ones who are older and one who has respiratory disease. I just want to KNOW, so I can try to at least do what I can to stop spread. It's supposed to be contagious for several weeks, from all I read.

This has been happening elsewhere, but I didn’t think it would happen here. I thought that, since I am young and healthy, I wouldn’t have to worry. And I still don’t think that I’ll get severely ill even if I contract COVID19. 

But I am terrified of the self-isolation. 

I have depression that gets exacerbated when I self-isolate on my own. I live alone, the vast majority of my social interactions are at school, and my family lives in another country. Once I heard the news that classes would only meet online for the rest of the term, it sunk in how much I enjoy school and how much of my social needs it fills. I have a hard time learning through online classes, so I’m nervous about coping with that too. 

I’m also feeling greater anxiety, like this is uncharted territory in our times. The world is afraid, people are stockpiling, major events are being cancelled. I know I’m young, and this hasn’t happened in my lifetime, but this is not normal. When will we feel safe again?

172,1584193184,Somnitec,Practical advice for traveling artists in a pinch?,"Hello all,

I am looking for some advice, not medical but rather for a practical advice. My partner and I are both traveling artists, or nomads if you prefer, and we do not have a fixed home. We are right now in The Netherlands (Brabant), originally for a job that has now been cancelled due to the outbreak. As a matter of fact, all our coming jobs have been cancelled until summer and for us that also means most of our accommodation/travel plans are cancelled too. We fully intend to follow the guidelines and safety measures, but it's hard to stay home when we don't have a home and the arrangement for our current accommodation ends in 4 days. We are not without options but we have some doubts on what to do best .

Our first option would be to travel to France to stay with family until the crisis is over.  However, we are afraid that we might carry the virus and that we would bring it to our family where some members are over 60 years old. It is hard to say if we are having symptoms, as we are just emerging out of a close-to -burnout, high stress and low sleep period, but have noticed some slight throat irritation and headaches. Additionally we know that we have been in one of the area's where the virus first emerged in this area for a concert of about 60 people 10 days ago. The area where we are right now as more cases of corona than where we would be going, so we feel conflicted about our need to find a comfortable and safe place to self-quarantine plus being close to family in case they would get sick and need help being taken care of, and the risk we might pose to the parents and other people around.  We also feel the pressure of a potential border lock-down coming up in the next week.

Would it be wise to find a short term rental to quarantine before going back to our family and for how long? Would we do that in the Netherlands or in France, closer to our destination? Wouldn't we risk to be reinfected/carry the virus by traveling after the quarantine anyway? A lot of confusion on what would be the safest thing to do. Any thoughts welcome, also if you have ideas on who we could discuss this without taking a needed time away from health professionals.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fiii1c/practical_advice_for_traveling_artists_in_a_pinch/
173,1584194710,GabrielLowery,I'm now starting to get really worried about coronavirus,"I'm usually the type of guy that doesn't worry about diseases like this. I remember the last two times stuff like this happened, with Ebola and Zika, the media blew it way out of proportion and made it seem worse than it was, when neither really spread to the United States and largely stayed in their areas. I assumed coronavirus was just another Ebola, something that would remain mainly in China, and then spread out to a couple isolated communites outside there, and that would be the end of it.

I thought wrong.

Now, schools have been closed for two weeks in my area. At first, I thought I was happy that school would be closed, but then I started getting anxious once I realized 1. just how long of a time period this was, and 2. the fact that stuff like this ideally shouldn't be happening

In addition, many major events have been cancelled. Given this, it makes me wonder just how much of life will be disrupted before coronavirus peaks. I legit feel like I'm in some apocayptic movie or something. I'm also concerned for my grandparents, and if they'll get it.

I think the biggest thing that keeps me worried is the relative lack of good news. I keep on hearing ""millions will get infected"", or ""it won't go away for months or years"", and honestly, that just worries me the fuck out. Not only that, but everyone seems to talk ONLY about coronavirus, and it's at that moment I really get worried. Even the r/coronavirus subreddit seems to have few good news on it. I know the fact we're in a state of emergency means we can get help, but...

We're still in an emergency...

And that's the main thing I'm concerned about. How bad will this get? I'm just afraid that no matter how much I isolate myself, I can't avoid it. And even if I did, it still wouldn't prevent my anxiety. I just want life to return to normal, but I get scared that maybe it won't, and maybe I have to live with the fact conditions like this may last for weeks or even months.

This year, 2020, was the year I was going to turn 18 and become an adult. I feel as if this is a coming-of-age moment for me, but not the one I deserved. What's more, the rest of my household isn't that worried, my brother is just as happy as he usually is, my mother is trying to calm me and isn't worried about it either, and my step-father is...just being quiet as usual.

I legit haven't had this much stress since 2017, when my family was having drama. When that happened, I almost experienced anhedonia, which is the inability to have pleasure, and that might happen with the coronavirus in 2020. I just wish I could focus on my own pleasures and just have fun, but it's hard when the world seems to be getting worse and worse.

It's moments like these that make me really nostalgic and wish I could go back to the past. I wish I could go back to 2012 when the biggest thing people were worried about was an apocalypse that never happened, or even 2014, which was when Ebola was going around, but it didn't turn out as people as people said, and it turned out to be overhyped. I just miss my past and my childhood. I wish I could be 9 or 10 again.

Honestly, I just wonder how my brother does it. I know he has autism, but I wish I was still as carefree as he is. I do sometimes go into states like his, especially when I'm actually happy and having fun, but now I worry when I'll be able to have fun again. When will things reopen, and how long will this period of fear last for?

I suppose the only good thing to come out of this is people will start practicing good hygeine finally...

But other than that, I'm especially sad/mad because I feel this year was ruined for me. I made this out to be ""my year"" and the year I start doing things, but now I fucking can't because of stupid coronavirus. Now I'm basically crippled in a state of constant fear until this fucking ends...

And when will it end...my brain wishes it would just end and be quick, but unfortunately, pandemics like this are usually slow and painful to sit through, watching as everything, and possibly everyone, becomes a victim. As a teenager, I'm not afraid I'll die from it, but I definitely don't want to catch it.

The media says it won't end until a year from now, and that millions will gets infected, including in the US. However, because the media sometimes exaggerates things, my prediction is that coronavirus will likely peak in April at least, and July at most. Even still, I can't wait that long. I enjoy alone time, but I actually feel claustrophobic now with the proposition I CAN'T escape. I wish I could ignore it, but when it's everywhere...I just can't. I can't escape hearing about coronavirus just as much as I'm afraid to leave the house now. I legit feel as if my house is a prison. And what if the worst-case scenarios are accurate...

And I'm not just worried about the virus, I'm worried about everything that'll come of it and its impact. This isn't like 9/11 where it killed tons of people at once (and I don't live in New York so I couldn't have died), this is something that kills people gradually, and that shit scares me even more.

What I'm getting is it's not just the immediate deaths, but the ensuing impact. I see tons of entertainment projects getting cancelled and delayed, and it makes me scared if it'll eventually impact businesses to the point of society basically shutting down. Or if enterainment will be so badly affected that literally everything is just reruns. There's also the financial impact. I'm worried if the economy is so badly damaged, that if we go homeless. Or what about shortages that cause me to fucking starve?

You know what this feels like? I feel as if I'm in some extremely poor country where diseases like this are to be expected, and the economy pretty much doesn't exist. I'm not spoiled or anything, but I definitely didn't ask for this kind of life.

I just hope we come back from thiis stronger, and that all the things we enjoy in life, Disney World, Netflix, memes, are still here, and better than ever.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fiiugs/im_now_starting_to_get_really_worried_about/
174,1584195684,GabrielLowery,"STAY OPTIMISTIC: If China and South Korea are any indications, coronavirus will not last forever","Some fearmongers are saying things like ""coronavirus will last forever"", or ""the world is ending"".

It is not.

China has already slowed down coronavirus exponentially. Now there are barely any new cases and there are more recoveries than cases at this point.

South Korea has also slowed coronavirus. There are not many new cases compared to last months, and recoveries have also increased past the new cases.

Both were infected in December or January. It is now March. They got over it in two, three months max.

Because they intervened.

It is crucial to remember that the US and other countries MUST do their job if they want to stop coronavirus, lest it cause a catastrophe.

If we want there to be a few thousand cases in the US, rather than a million, we must intervene and cure those infected.

Like I said in my last post, which I actually wrote yesterday, coronavirus will go away on its own most likely, and it'll probably peak here in the US by late April at least, and June at most. May/June is my prediction for the world. I wouldn't be surprised if by then, the news focuses on some other crap like the election or the Olympics (which is also why the Olympics shouldn't be canceled yet, simply because by the time it happens, it may no longer be a major threat). I wish I could say ""this is as bad as its gonna get here"", but realistically, it could reach Italy levels of bad, especially with poor intervention.

The reason China and South Korea have started recovering from coronavirus, and also why Taiwan has fought off to prevent an outbreak, is good intervention. We can't just pretend it doesn't exist and continue to live normal life. We have to wait. I know it'll be uncomfortable, but if you take good precautions, and try to isolate yourself for the time being (especially if you're in a severely affected community), you will likely not get the coronavirus.

Society isn't going to collapse. Will coronavirus lead to a recession? Possibly, and it's starting to look likely, but if we can stay calm, we can make sure that this isn't a ""millions die"" infection, but a ""thousands die"" infection. People will die from this, it's inevitable, but you can make sure it's no one close to you.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fij2it/stay_optimistic_if_china_and_south_korea_are_any/

Try to follow these guidlines for 14 days as it usually shows symptoms within that time period

1. Stay in your room. Avoid any physical contact.
2.Clean properly after using common utilities like washroom, taps, don't touch unnecessary places, clean it, if you don't (mark on that spot and ask others to not touch there). 
3. Use hand sanitizer or wash your before using common things like plates, wash them if you use any. 
4. Wash your own clothes, do your own dishes.
5. Keep distance during any interaction and use face mask while talking.
6. Ask anyone to wash their hands if they touch the same thing as you

The guidelines mentioned are of the strictest order, try to modify it as per your use case, given the knowledge of how it spread. https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-transmission#infected-surfaces

They are taking things more seriously than some people I’m seeing (like sanitizing and washing hands, my dad wipes down his steering wheel when he needs to leave the home, they disinfect, etc), but they refuse to buy more groceries (they can afford it), or let my husband help by doing their errands and dropping things on the porch. my mom can not wrap her mind around not being able to see my daughter. I’ve tried to delicately say “hey mom, children don’t seem to be getting sick but they think they can pass this on to people easily, like grandparents, and that makes us nervous”. She just kind of brushes it off, “ok so we won’t see her this weekend, but what about next??”. Any advice or informative links on what to show the elderly to make them understand they need to stay home?? Or ideas on how to broach to my parents they may not be able to see their grandkid for awhile?

I've never been this scared before in my life. I've more in the past couple days than I have in probably years. I'm terrified for my family--  especially for my grandparents who absolutely aren't healthy, and my parents. My mom is my rock and I can't imagine losing her or my dad. But even if we make it through without getting sick/only mild sickness, I'm so scared for the future financially. My whole life, we've lived check to check. We have no insurance. A hospital stay would ruin us. Even outside of that, with the stock market in flames and talk of another recession/depression, I can't help but brace for us to lose our jobs. My mom's a teacher, my dad works in the auto industry (he was already laid off during the 2008 crisis), and I work a very non essential job for a non-profit that has had money issues in the past. The closest friends I have work at a tattoo studio and I'm terrified for their health and the future of their shop itself since we live in a place that absolutely is not taking this seriously.

195,1584228584,Orly_yarly_ouirly,"At the risk of sounding preachy, I feel like I’ve turned a corner from paralyzing anxiety to positivity and hope [x-post r/COVanonymous]","A couple days ago, I posted a long list of all the terrifying hypothetical things that could come out of this coronavirus mess. All of those thoughts have been swimming around my head for the past few weeks, and this week in particular it became unbearable.

So, I did what any 30 year old woman does in trying times... I called my mom. I basically unloaded on her and sobbed the whole time. She was super calm and did a great job of talking me down.

After that, I realized two things:

1. If I don’t get my anxiety under control, I will create a dangerous situation for myself if it gets to the point where i do have to quarantine. I would lose my shit if I was that anxious AND home bound.

2. I also realized that, every time I spew out my anxious thoughts, while it may make me feel better, it basically forces other people to now consider those thoughts as well - kind of like inception. All my paranoia about martial law and worst case scenarios came from reading reddit subs where people were freaking out. If I never read those, I may not have even considered that as something to be afraid of. Then, when I unload on people IRL, I’m giving other people another thing to worry about.

So... this is not to say that we should be bottling up our feelings. But, rather, we should consider how we communicate our feelings. We don’t need to inadvertently spread misinformation and fear by spewing out things we read online. It’s ok to say you’re anxious - just don’t drag other people down the rabbit hole too while you’re venting.

And on to the hopeful bit: I’m starting to think of this time as an opportunity for us to learn how to make do with less stuff. Maybe this will be a catalyst for taking serious steps to address global warming. Maybe this will be a catalyst for a new kind of economy where more people work remotely and services that used to be static turn more mobile. This kind of shift could also help reduce emissions.

Lastly, I think it will be REALLY important to spread kindness when we can. This virus, through quarantine and social distancing, will divide us. It’s up to us to bridge that divide (safely, without sharing germs) and help others who need it. Even sharing a smile with people as you walk down the street. We’re all in this together, we’re all feeling anxious about this time of uncertainty, we all deserve a bit of kindness from others.

PS: Avoid the reddit rabbit hole as much as you can. Misinformation will prove to be far more dangerous than this virus.

PPS: I’m not perfect and I can’t say I’ve made a 100% change in my outlook - I still have an anxious moment here and there - but, it’s become MUCH more manageable in the past few days. Let that be the goal - to increase the positive feelings and decrease the negative feelings little by little.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/firr4a/at_the_risk_of_sounding_preachy_i_feel_like_ive/

There won't be a lot of back of house support, but I imagine the venue will have at least... 10-15 additional people milling about doing various things? So around 170-180 folks drinking, eating, sweating, dancing, and trying to act like everything is normal.

She's floated the idea of canceling or trying to reschedule, but obviously this is weighing pretty hard. She paid an outlandish amount of $ to have hand sanitizer on every table and is in the process of contacting everyone invited to tell them more about the situation (amount of people attending, what the venue is doing to clean/support, ask them to confirm again if they are coming, ask them not to attend if they have been exposed or are feeling sick, etc). Almost everyone is driving in or already local.

Her city has issued guidance discouraging gatherings over 250, but hasn't formally prohibited them.

If she does decide to have the event, what's the best way to mitigate the potential risks? The venue doesn't seem like they are going to pull the plug (unless directed by the state/city).

Any thoughts appreciated. She's taking it in stride right now (she wanted to elope afterall), but if she decides to cancel I think she'll be really upset and I don't know how to help.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/firyv4/wedding_planned_for_next_weekend_practical_advice/

I was already at the end of my rope, can't-take-this-anymore from my once-again-spiraling depression and anxiety since November. And that was just from life, in general. 

Now theres *this*

Putting aside all the future fears of death, economic collapse, and prolonged stir-crazy, putting aside the short-term fears of *oh god, I have to wake up tomorrow and do this all over again*, there's the midrange: my job. At a grocery store.

On one hand, we're not losing customers like so many other places! On the other hand...so. many. customers. My department (deli) wasnt hit as hard, but with all the talk about cancelling large gatherings, it's hard not to think: what about us? How many people did I talk to, walk by, breathe by? What about my coworkers? There were people pulling double shifts, standing at checkstands, stocking shelves, all in the thick of it. 

I'm not in a high risk group myself, but getting really sick still sucks even when you don't die. And spreading it to people, worsening the problem, yeah, thats a fear. 

So, I guess, I don't know what to do. I need money. With the economy heading downward, I need money bad. But my workplace is basically a petri dish with bad radio music. Why is this considered okay? People talk about shelves being stripped bare, but not about who had to fill them up again.

205,1584234288,Theseus_The_King,Just some things to remember to keep yourself sane,"It’s been hard to come to terms with this virus. The media and 24 hour news cycle makes it sound like we’re living in a stupid ass 14 year olds Pandemic game, complete with a virus named after a beer. For those of us who are investors, it seems as if one day it’ll zero out and there will be no economy left. For people in affected areas, it feels like the governments re dragging their feet no matter how much action.
Everyday seems to go from bad to worse, that there will be no light at the end of this tunnel, that uncontrolled spread is inevitable, worldwide cases will double by the day and tomorrow we’ll be living in bunkers with corpses strewn on the deserted streets. Any semblance of normalcy will be a distant memory for the last fading remnants of humanity.

With the media painting a picture that we are careening rapidly and inexorably to the demise of civilization and order, I think it’s high time for a reality check. Here are 5 things to remember at a time like right now. 

1. THIS TOO SHALL PASS. Repeat this 10 times every day. This too shall pass, this too shall pass. Remember three months ago when we all were supposed to have perished in nuclear hellfire in a war with Iran? Remember when it looked like Australia would be burnt to a crisp entirely by the end of January? Those situations were dire, but abated when they were given time. Perhaps some times pass harder, but they pass still. At some points, the worst will be behind us. Things will go back to normal, even if it is a slightly different normal. 

2. The recovery is inevitable. Imagine what kinds of great things that can come of the recovery and rebuild. A restored priority on transparency and democracy. Illiberal governments finally facing the music and being shown the door at long last. Unprecedented scientific advances in antivirals and vaccines. Countries that are more prepared than ever to deal with anything. Actual sick pay and labor laws. An economy that has prioritized the climate and is growing in ways it did not before. Hold on to your investments. You cannot profit of the recovery of something you sold. 

3. Humanity has overcome far worse, and by all means this will not be what past plagues were. The Black Death killed one third of Europe. Spanish flu killed 50 million. 1957 Avian flu killed 1 million. Swine flu in 2009 killed only 12500. Advances in medical technology have improved survival over time. Unlike any of the past pandemics, we can identify and map this virus, and develop a response strategy accordingly. We know the incubation period, how it works and who needs more protection. We have more ability to treat the even more dangerous sequelae like bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics. In 1918, penicillin was still a decade away, and viruses were a new concept. There is a reason Dr Tedros is saying this is the first time we have the ability to contain and control a pandemic. We as a whole can stop it right here . 

4. There is now a lot of public awareness and public action. Here is the thing: because of the incubation period, quarantines, lockdowns, and closures do not show effect until 10-14 days. Even at China’s peak, cases rapidly increased before plateauing two weeks after Wuhan’s lockdown. There needs to be patience for the actions today to mean fewer infections and deaths tomorrow. The horror numbers of 50-70% infection comes from zero controls and zero consideration until herd immunity steps in. It is far from an inevitability, even Hubei was able to plateau at 0.12% infected. If Italy is quarantining now they may not even get to that much. At the very least governments are not doing anything. 

5. There are things you can do to control your risk. Wash your hands, avoid touching your face, don’t come into work sick. These are not just for now. These are good habits people should have been doing anyways, pandemic or not. It would be wonderful if subsequent flu seasons are less
Deadly because people picked up good habits.

The most important thing is not to give in to panic. A few weeks where things look a bit different is a flash in the pan when you have many years of life to live. Turn off the news, turn off the TV, focus on yourself and productivity while taking steps to protect yourself. This too will pass, if you’re willing to be patient.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fit4z8/just_some_things_to_remember_to_keep_yourself_sane/

I live in FL and I'm worried the virus is worst then what's being reported. 
We've had 3 deaths and over 77 confirmed cases so far. I know the US has kinda dropped the ball on the testing however, we're just now ramping up with testing and setting up drive through testing so that's some good news. 

I'm just a little disturbed seeing reports coming from Italy saying this virus doesn't just target older people, and affects younger people too and there ending up in the hospital.

I'm 26 and fairly healthy! But I worry about myself, my wife and my parents (mid 50's) are also pretty healthy. 

I just can't get the thought out of my head about losing my parents or other loved ones! I also worry about leaving behind my 2 year old son. 

I've been cleaning my hands and telling my parents to do the same. I'm even considering staying home for a couple weeks until everything blows over.

I’m in a household where we’re less than 50 miles away from San Mateo. No one here takes this seriously despite my pleas. They continue to go out, make plans with friends, don’t practice any form of social distancing. They truly don’t understand the gravity of the situation. I can isolate myself and wash my hands all I want, but by the time these people realize how serious this is it’ll be too late.

The only family I have is my mother, who is in her 60s and has underlying health conditions. I myself also suffer from underlying health conditions, clinical depression, OCD and severe anxiety... I'm scared to death of my mother catching this virus and being one of the unlucky ones to suffer its severe consequences, If I lose her I have absolutely nothing, nothing. I do not know what to do... We can't stay locked up, I need to get supplies and I eventually need to go into college. I am conscious of mine and my mothers well-being, but others are not conscious of theirs and those around them. I've seen group chats of people in my college and other colleges not self-isolating even though they are ill and have symptoms. People are not acting on government advice, they aren't acting responsibly, they're only thinking of themselves.

ive seen a post of annonymus person that explains their problems with anxiety and the coronavirus situation and they explain that they had thoughts of diferent scenarios of armagedon or end of the world and i have a point to say to everyone:
people with anxiety belive in this beacuse of pression or fear yes fear of loosing something (like loved ones) and i think the help they need is someone to hear them and just like comfort them beacuse these toughts cant fully go away and we have those type of problems (like my tachycardia for example or suicidal thoughts)
comfort for my anxiety homies is really important beacuse if they get out of the hole they are trapped in they can be more understanding and help other anxiety homies that are struggling with problems.

220,1584250390,the_estimator,"Maybe infected, feel awful about everyone I had contact with","Apologies for the long post. I know that there’s not really any advice beyond what I’m already doing, but I need to vent with the anonymity of the internet.

Three days ago, I had to go to the ER because it was so hard for me to breathe. After they did my vitals and blood tests, they concluded that I have a “viral respiratory syndrome with bronchospasms.” Because I hadn’t been out of the country, I didn’t qualify for a coronavirus test; all they could test me for was influenza and bacterial pneumonia, both negative. They had to give me two albuterol treatments to be well enough to go home.

Of course, I have been self-quarantining since I got back from the hospital. I don’t have asthma, but the tiniest bit of exertion makes me out of breath. They gave me an albuterol inhaler with 200 doses; I have to keep up with 2 puffs every four hours while I’m awake or I feel shitty again.

I’m hoping to recover soon, and in terms of resources, I’m fine. Emotionally, not good.

First, I’m thinking of who I may have infected. I do a charity food delivery to an older couple with health issues who can’t drive. My last delivery to them, including extra bottles of hand soap, was five days before I started having symptoms. I also got an extra bottle of soap for my neighbor, also an older woman with health issues who can’t drive. I tried to call my neighbor earlier today but she didn’t answer the phone. I’m debating who I should call to check on her since I don’t want to risk going anywhere near her.

Second, all my family is on the other side of the country. The ones who are in my age group are taking this seriously, which is good. My parents though, I’m not sure. They’re concerned for me of course, but overall they just seem irritated about the logistics. I’d already been planning on moving out to be near them. I was going to fly, but now the plan is for my mom to fly out to me, help me pack, then we drive back. They don’t seem to be thinking of the possibility that domestic flights will be cancelled. They’re operating under the assumption that the only people who should worry is elderly people and immune-compromised while everyone else will be mildly inconvenienced.

Third, I’m worried about my grandparents. My grandpa is ill and has dementia. He still lives at home and my grandma is his primary caregiver. They are exactly the demographic that’s going to be hit hard by this. Thankfully they have family nearby to check on them, but what if they visit while asymptomatic?

Fourth (and most selfishly) I’m worried about my own health. None of this is a normal way for my body to react to an infection. Research has clearly been showing that some people, even young people without prior health problems, sometimes are having permanent lung damage. If I’m one of those people, how much and how will it affect me later? I don’t know how to talk to my family about it without them thinking it’s my anxiety talking and spend all their time reassuring me when I really just want to vent.

My grandma has been the best person to talk to, but I don’t want to worry her more than she already is. It just feels like a lot of pressure to be reassuring when I don’t feel that way myself.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fiwl74/maybe_infected_feel_awful_about_everyone_i_had/

234,1584277682,emma3mma5,Advice on managing life,"This seems like a trivial thing to ask but I have no idea what to do at all so here goes:

* I work in the entertainment industry so there’s a lot of faff about keeping up appearances and networking in person if possible. Especially when people can have so little time, I do always feel pressure to keep them as it can be months before I see a person again. Also, I’m in the UK, so things like mass gatherings aren’t shut down by government order yet as of writing. Theatres, tours and productions within the country are still mostly ongoing and such. I feel a lot of pressure to keep going especially as most people I know in my line of work in the UK are doing so too (in part because we have to for financial reasons).
* I live with several family members who are over sixty and have been seriously ill and I am honestly living in fear that I infect them. They are my only family and I have anxiety anyway which doesn’t help, but I’ve been firmly at home for weeks unless essential. I've only had to go into London once in the past few weeks and to say I was anxious the entire time is an understatement.

So...

* I don’t know what is or isn’t safe for me to do now - I think going to the shops to get food is fine but what about something as simple as a hair appointment, going to a seminar in London where there will be a small crowd (under 50 people) or even just keeping my tattoo appointment? Are all those things safe to do if my hairdresser or tattooist will come into close contact with me? Let alone the transport risks just by taking the underground? I have all these things coming up but I have no problem moving them if necessary, as disappointed as I might be to do so.

I very much appreciate that some of these things sound so trivial but I have no idea what the balance between trying to keep your life normal and keeping home is anymore and I'm getting more afraid the more I think about it. I know I can work myself up more and more, and so any advice from people more clued in and aware about the virus than me would be so appreciated.

236,1584280056,CoffeeShopAuthor,Parents want me to return to the midwest from NYC,"Hey Reddit

More than anything, I need some other opinions and views on a situation my brother and myself are in. It's been a rough 48 hours.

I live in NYC in Queens. As I'm sure a lot of people know already, things are not looking good here. It's been nerve-wracking. My mom asked us to return to our hometown in IL to be out of the way of the virus. She claimed that they don't have any cases where she lives so it's safer to live there and not be in isolation in a major city, and there would be no ""riots"" over food shortages, like she is predicting will happen in NYC if we go on lockdown. She and my father are both in high-risk categories. We told them we wanted to see how things developed over the next few days because we didn't want to take any travel risks and there was still a lot up in the air; my brother's college was still open. This was Thursday. My mother has threatened us by saying she will stay in NYC if we won't go out with her, even though she's high-risk.

This weekend they just showed up at my doorstep with a rental car, expecting us to go to IL the next day. My brother and I have stalled them long enough to try and make a decision.

Brief backstory - my mother has a severe personality disorder. She's extremely obsessive with my little brother and myself and would risk public health if it meant we would be closer or if we moved back to our hometown. Every other phone call I have had with her for the last three years has involved her making up scenarios for us to move back home.  

Guys. I don't want to spread COVID-19. I'm healthy and not showing symptoms, but I know the virus can take a while to become symptomatic. I worked in retail at the start of the NYC outbreak and I have had contact with the general public (obsessively following CDC hygiene guidelines, but still).  My job closed for the week and I could easily isolate myself in Queens. I'm so afraid I might contract it. Leaving the city just seems like an opportunity to possibly infect this small town, my high-risk parents and anyone along the way.

So I've got two parents begging me to travel via car to the Midwest and NYC on the verge of a possible shutdown. 

Any advice? Is anyone under lockdown in a similar city? Is the shutdown bad? Are there any ""riots"" over food? I'm so torn about what to do; I've been crying all day and night. I want to believe they want the best for me but I also want to do what's best for the welfare of other citizens.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fj1k1m/parents_want_me_to_return_to_the_midwest_from_nyc/

248,1584307144,ExpertgamerHB,Good things to remember when you're frightened about the virus,"Here are some things I find to help me stay relaxed and sane about the current situation with the virus. Some might have already been said here but they're worth repeating!:

1. The exponential growth of new cases as we're shown now is not a model that can sustain itself for long, because it assumes everyone will keep meeting new people to infect every day. But in our daily lives, we generally keep meeting the same people. Even in public places, you will only keep meeting people who are healthy, naturally immune (this is a thing!) or have been cured of the virus (after all, sick people should stay at home or are hospitalized). So the bottom line is, people who spread the virus will run out of people to infect pretty fast. This is true for every single case. 
2. We will not see millions of people worldwide die from this, because of regulations that are being put in place everywhere. COVID-19 will not be Spanish Flu 2.0., the Black Plague, etc.  
3. The virus will not infect everyone. You're likely to be among those people as long as you follow the local regulations that are in place and follow basic hygiene instructions. Wash your hands, avoid sick people, wash your hands, do not go out (especially if you're feeling unwell!), wash your hands, do not travel, wash your hands, do not meet with other people unless it is strictly necessary. Wash your hands. Don't be a selfish prick. Please do wash your hands. 
4. The virus presents itself as mild in 80% of *recorded* cases. This number is likely higher since not everyone with the virus calls their GP/CDC because symptoms are not severe enough. Remember, the influenzaviruses and rhinoviruses that spread the common cold are still around too.   
Even if you do get infected, you are very likely to experience symptoms akin to flu and nothing more severe than that. Young people might be able to develop more severe illness, yes, it happens but these cases are rare overall. This is not any different from flu where more severe illness in healthy and young people can happen as well.   
I had flu once when I was an otherwise healthy 15 years old. I was bedridden for two weeks, had a raging fever of 105F/40.5C for four days. I almost needed hospitalization. Thankfully I made a miraculous recovery before I reached that point. I haven't had anything that severe since, and I've had my fair share of flu and colds between then and now.
5. If you start showing symptoms and you start to panic and want to call emergency services right away: ask yourself if you would call them when you'd have the same symptoms if COVID-19 wasn't around. If the answer's no: stay at home, get some rest, and monitor your symptoms and health a couple of times a day. If you only have a mild cough for a couple of days and nothing else develops, for example, it's probably something else. But if you do develop a high fever and/or trouble breathing, call your GP or emergency services right away. Better safe than sorry. Don't go outside if you experience any symptoms no matter how minor, though!
6. Even in Hubei, a city with millions of citizens, less than 70.000 people got infected. That sounds like a lot, but in reality, it's less than 0,12% of their population infected. The vast majority of these infected people recovered as well. Their regulations were helpful for sure, so keep in mind to follow the regulations of your local authorities diligently to limit spread. You can make a difference!
7. The effects of regulations put in place today will start to show themselves in two weeks at earliest, so don't worry if numbers don't slow down right away. They WILL slow down sooner than later. China and South-Korea are great examples. 
8. The media intentionally write articles in such a way that it would garner the most clicks and thus more money. And fear is what sells the best. They love throwing big numbers around but often fail to provide the bigger picture unless it can generate more fear and thus clicks/money. The news outlets I frequent do not mention the number of people that have recovered from the virus for example and only keeps on adding to the total number of confirmed infections whilst failing to mention that the first couple of hundred cases have already recovered. Try to approach the news with a more neutral and nuanced view. Again, Hubei. Almost 70.000 people infected. It's still just 0.12% of their population. Approach numbers with that mindset. 
9. Limit your time getting informed about the virus. You will only be more likely to stumble across anecdotal horror stories and other scary things if you keep looking for more information. Only take the latest information seriously from sources such as your government, CDC and GP. Tune in to the news once or twice a day. Also, try to keep updated with news that's relevant for your area first and foremost. For example, news about new regulations in Asian countries is mostly irrelevant for you if you live in America. 
10. This will come to pass. There will come a day where you wake up and you can resume your daily life as normal. This day is closer than the media, internet users and other skeptics make it out to be. 

Stay healthy, vigilant and follow instructions of your local authorities in order to limit the spread!",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fj8s6n/good_things_to_remember_when_youre_frightened/

254,1584311540,remyymer13,Worried and confused about potential quarantine,"I'm in NC in the US. I just learned of at least 2 cases of COVID-19 in my county. I'm suddenly a lot more nervous than I was before. I have several questions about what happens if there is a government-imposed quarantine and I don't know who else to ask.

First of all, does anyone know how likely it is that a government-imposed quarantine will happen? At what level would it happen (city, county, state, national, etc.)? And how long can a quarantine like that last?

In the event of a quarantine like that, what exactly happens? Can we not leave our homes at all? I live in apartment with my dog. It's just the two of us. Will I have to stay cooped up here by myself, not even allowed to step outside? What do I do about letting my dog exercise and go potty? She's a 55lb growing puppy, so frequent bathroom breaks and playtimes are important for both of our sanities and I don't know how I can handle having her inside for an extended period of time like that. And for going potty inside, I know they have little indoor fake grass things for dogs, but I don't know how I'm supposed to get one if we're under quarantine. I'm assuming Amazon won't be making deliveries if we're under quarantine? What about groceries and other necessities? How do I get groceries if we go under quarantine? What about my job? I know I won't be fired or something like that, but how am I supposed to handle going without work for however long a quarantine lasts?

I'm just really nervous all of a sudden. The virus felt distant and not threatening, and now it's suddenly in my backyard. I feel like I'm totally in the dark about what's going on. I'm trying to follow the news, but all I'm hearing about it more cases and not what the future holds or how to handle the situation. I know that no one will have definite answers to these questions, but any idea is helpful. I'm a college student and I live several hours away from my family. Most of my friends have gone home to their families so I'm feeling very alone. I feel like I'm doing a good job at not panicking, but I'm still nervous and my thoughts are spiraling a bit.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fj9x3e/worried_and_confused_about_potential_quarantine/
255,1584311583,remyymer13,Autistic college student dealing with changes due to pandemic,"Sorry for the long post, but I'm starting to spiral and trying not to panic. I'm an introverted college student that deals with mental illness (depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies) and mild autism. My spring break started last week and was extended another week. When classes start back up, they'll be online.

I thrive on structure. I do well when I regularly have to interact with people in person, have a schedule to follow and have responsibilities/obligations. It's hard to find the right balance of responsibilities and obligations to keep me going but not to stress me out and make me shut down. I live alone with my dog.

After hearing about my school's response to the virus, I feel like I've been blindsided or hit by a truck. Just an extra week of no class was bad news. An extra (unplanned) week of no classes, no structure, no human interaction is really tough and probably not going to end well for me. And having classes online isn't great either. I'm already panicking at the idea and feel like I will probably fail. I feel like I would be able to handle a single online class, but not a whole course load online.

Being alone is also tough. As an introvert, it's difficult to find the right balance of interacting with people and having enough alone time, but I need at least some in-person human contact. I can have my weekly therapy sessions over the phone, but I hate phone calls and know that this won't compare to in-person therapy. Also, because of extended spring break, many of my friends and fellow students have gone home to their families. I know that we ought to stay away from the public and it's not likely that I would be able to see my friends anyway, but knowing that they're all so far away contributes to my overall feeling of loneliness and hopelessness.

I know a solution could be to give myself a more structured schedule. Like set a schedule or a to do list or something. But I don't do well with this either. I can't seem to self-impose structure. It has to be set by someone else and enforced by someone else.

I'm also worried about the virus. I know I'm young and healthy, but I still personally don't want to get sick and I'm worried about my loved ones that are at higher risk of being affected. I don't really know what's going on with the virus or what's going to happen (I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fj9x3e/worried_and_confused_about_potential_quarantine/) about my concerns with quarantine). I'm scared about being alone with my dog if we're under quarantine because I don't know how to handle it, in a practical what-do-we-do sense or in an emotional how-do-I-keep-myself-sane sense.

I don’t really have any options of where else to go since I don’t want to leave him for potentially weeks or months. All our relatives within 3 hours drive are older and thus at higher risk.

Technically I am still expected to go to work but anticipate taking vacation/sick days as I wait for the tests to come back on my husband’s patients, as I don’t want to be a vector at my work.

259,1584313307,Vegetable-Chain,Have been positive – but now I feel completely depressed,"I really just need to vent. I've been pretty calm about the whole thing for a couple weeks now, but in the last two days I can't shake my anxiety and depression.

I live in the US and I come from a family that has a history of anxiety, germaphobia, and OCD. My mother is agoraphobic and works from home (grateful for that right now), and my father is a SEVERE germaphobe, on the verge of being agoraphobic and really should be seeking therapy. I'm a 21-year-old only child, and right now I'm in school and am able to be preoccupied with all my schoolwork and hobbies. The lockdown gives me a chance to work on my music, study for some exams I have to take this summer, learn to sew, paint, read, exercise, etc.

As positive as all that is, I can't shake my anxiety. I had a day about two weeks ago where I lied in bed for hours unable to get up because I was having anxiety about the virus. Since then, I've been feeling better, reading a lot of articles about it, and keeping busy. But in the US, things blew completely out of proportion in literally three days. Since then, people have been panicking to the extreme, especially my parents. This is the worst kind of thing to happen for parents like mine. I feel worse for them than I do for myself.

My personal concerns lie with others. I have the means to not leave the house for months and I am grateful, but others don't. I'm worried about people and children who don't have food or a stable home, I'm worried about the repercussions of this and how hard it might be for me or my family to find work once this is over. I'm concerned about my extended family yes, but I am also very concerned for my boyfriend (who is still going out and still has to work). He has severe depression, bipolar, BPD. I'm concerned that he will a.) get the virus and not care, not do anything to get better or b.) will finally be told he can't go to work and therefore can no longer afford his therapy, his car insurance, etc. (he works at a grocery store so this is very unlikely, but it could happen). Every time I tell him to just stay home, he won't. He can't do that and even if he could, he probably wouldn't.

Yes this was possibly the year AND the summer I was going to go on a few trips, graduate, see one of my favorite bands, POSSIBLY get engaged... and everyone has selfish concerns during a time like this. But I am so worried for other people. I'm oversensitive and I can't bare the thought of people not having food or shelter. Like I mentioned, I'm also incredibly worried about my boyfriend. My father (because of his own issues) has disallowed me from seeing my boyfriend and going to work, which I agree with to an extent, but I miss him and really hope he doesn't get the virus. I can't even just get up and go somewhere because (perfect timing) my car battery died and can't afford to replace it right now obviously. Not that I want to anyway, I have my own issues in the past with germaphobia.

Luckily I have a therapist at school who is still keeping our weekly appointments through phone. I'm a huge yogi and have been able to do lots of yoga during this. There's so many things I'm grateful for and that's why I've been feeling relatively calm... but not anymore. Now this all feels nightmareish. Any good news to calm me down would be appreciated, even though I've probably read it before :(",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fjaegc/have_been_positive_but_now_i_feel_completely/

The three confirmed cases in my province are travel-related, I haven’t personally travelled, and I haven’t been in contact with anyone known to be confirmed with the virus. 

However my mind keeps thinking about the 2 week incubation period. I have been in contact with the past 2 weeks with people who had travelled from the US, but they didn’t appear sick. 

I haven’t shown any other symptoms such as coughing or a fever, just a “shortness of breath feeling” in my chest, although I don’t even know what that feels like so I can’t be too sure that’s how to describe that feeling? I’m not even sure if shortness of breath would be the first symptom or not, or would appear before a fever.

3,1584318736,Cloud9Shopper,Depression and thoughts of suicide during COVID distancing.,"This is at least the third or fourth time in as many hours that I’m crying and don’t know what to do. In normal times, I’m fairly introverted by nature and enjoy the fact that my job lets us work from home once a week and has a relaxed environment as a perk. But now I’m so unsure and beyond freaked out by all the news, panic, and speculation from everyone from news anchors to doctors to people on other subs and on Facebook pretending they’re experts. 

My company is now mandating work from home for the next two weeks unless your job can’t be done from home. My boss has instituted a daily video call with the team to check in and talk about priorities for the day/week. Even with that and generally appreciating the remote work perk that existed before this, I just can’t imagine not being onsite for two weeks and not physically seeing my team. 

I also work part time in season for a minor league baseball team. My job is only during home games. No baseball now means I may have to sacrifice a summer of secondary income, especially since MLB’s outlook keeps changing from “reassess in two weeks” to “maybe it’ll start in May” to “no games until June.” I am devastated. I love my job (selling 50/50 to support a local charity) and my boss and the fans I normally interact with. That has all been taken from me. I take pride in my work there; I’ve been selling the 50/50 since 2016. If I was just a baseball fan, it would suck to live without going to Yankees games, but it would be more manageable. Losing my work just hurts more even if it is only part time and I have my regular full time job. 

I just joined a community service group but our meetings for the month are canceled. Luckily we didn’t cancel a service project we have planned for the end of this month. 

Pretty soon, I’m sure all restaurants will be closed. All movie theaters. I can’t watch hockey now even since that’s postponed and maybe even done for the year. I am Catholic and went to church today, but I fear soon churches will be the next thing shuttered and I won’t even have my faith or the comfort of attending physical Masses. (Yes I know some churches live stream and you can watch TV Mass in my area from the diocese cathedral but it doesn’t compare to being in a church with a community.) 

I have struggled with suicidal thoughts and worst case thinking before, and now I want to die all over again. With no positive outlets aside from work and it just being me and my apartment and TV if our governor (PA) forces everything to close, I don’t see a lot of hope. Hell I even went to the store just now and not being able to find pork or hot dog buns because the shelves were so bare just made me feel crappier.

I have offered to pick up groceries for some elderly and immuno-compromised neighbors, and it made me sad to think that a lot of people might not have helpers in their life.  If you are elderly or immuno-compromised, you might be nervous about going to the grocery store or picking up your prescriptions at this time.  If you did not already know that it is possible to get groceries and prescriptions delivered to your house, I wanted to share some resources with you.  

Instacart ([https://www.instacart.com/](https://www.instacart.com/)) will charge a small fee to deliver groceries to your home from your local grocery store.

Amazon Pantry ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/pantry/info/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/pantry/info/)) is another good option, especially because panic-buying has emptied a lot of local store shelves.  If you have an Amazon Prime membership, you can get Amazon Pantry deliveries for free on orders over $35.

CVS Pharmacy ([https://www.cvs.com/content/delivery](https://www.cvs.com/content/delivery)) is offering free delivery on prescriptions during the COVID-19 outbreak.  Find your prescription information on the label on your bottle or packaging, and that will help you log in.

I apologize if this has already been posted.  **Please feel free to share other resources as well in your comments.**  I know there are other options like Task Rabbit too.

Thanks for reading.  We can get through this.  Take care!",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fjdxwh/grocery_and_prescription_delivery/

I need to go to the dentist and get a tooth pulled but i'm so scared that I may catch the virus or that having a tooth pulled will make me more weak against the virus. I'm 24 years old and i'm healthy-ish other than being a couch potato and eating un-healthy I don't have any major health problems that I know of or affect me on a daily basis. But I have horrible dental problems and I'm just scared that If I go to the dentist that I will get the virus, or that if I do go to the dentist and have my tooth pulled it would make my immune system weaker to the virus. I'm also scared because my mom keeps on going out to the mall etc. so I just don't feel safe from the virus and I'm just kinda panicking at this moment and scared that my tooth is going to cause a infection or something worse. I have anxiety so I just don't know what to do.

I guess  I knew this sort of shut down to everyday life was inevitable, though I still not coping very well. I am a college senior in the last semester of my undergraduate who has been looking forward to this spring/summer as the best time of my life. I go to school full time, live in residence, and work two jobs on my university campus, as well as participates in lots of societies and clubs. I was looking forward to graduating this spring and walking across the stage in front of my family (I’ve even had a countdown on my phone for 4 years, lol!) and was planning on going on my first ever trip to Scotland by myself in April. I had my dream summer job lined up at a music festival and was planning on getting my very first apartment. Now, my life has completely fallen down around me. My university has been shut down so I’ve lost my home, my job, my graduation, all the galas and dinners I was looking forward to attending, all of my extracurriculars, and had to cancel my trip. The festival I was supposed to be working at also got cancelled, leaving me with no job lined up for the summer and nowhere to live. On top of this, all of my friends that I have made during my time at school had to abruptly go home without goodbyes, most of whom I may never see again. In one day, absolutely everything that had been keeping me afloat has been taken away. I’ve suffered from clinical depression for years now but had managed to keep it under control for the past few months, but now I feel like I am back to square one? Anybody else here in the same boat? I feel so selfish complaining knowing people around the world are dying from this virus but I just can’t help but feel devastated. The final nail in the coffin was the announcement that my convocation ceremony would not be postponed but outright cancelled. I have been dreaming about being able to celebrate my graduation with my friends and family and walk across that stage for years and now I have not been able to stop crying.

My stepdad is taking the coronavirus outbreak seriously and is only going out for essential errands like food shopping. However, my mum is taking a more devil-may-care attitude and has said things like ""if I catch it, I catch it."" She is still going out socialising with friends, for example going out for meals and going to the cinema. 

Tomorrow night, I'm due to go out with my mum and some of her friends to a local restaurant for a meal. To make it worse, the organiser of the meal has just returned from a holiday in Egypt. I asked my mum whether she thought the meal out would be cancelled. I also said I don't think it's a good idea for us to go, as several other countries have already shut down bars and restaurants (I'm from the UK and I think our government is dithering too much with regards to asking people to socially isolate, so I've been following what governments in other European countries are doing. I also started working from home as of this morning). When I mentioned this, my mum got annoyed and said ""so I can't go to the cinema and now we can't even go out for a meal. It's boring staying at home and it feels like life is on hold!""

It's a shame because this meal out had originally been planned many weeks ago, but we had to postpone it because of people being ill (non-coronavirus related).

I don't mind social isolating, personally - I've got loads of books, magazines, films and online courses I can catch up on over the coming weeks, and everything else (eg restaurants) will still be there once all this is over. My mum has lots of books she hasn't read and CDs she hasn't listened to, so I don't know how she can say it's boring staying at home. I guess I'm more introverted.

I have been diagnosed with asthma since I was a kid but it was never anything severe to my knowledge. I had to regularly use inhalers (first by breathing in some substance through some tube with a funnel attached to it, later using smaller disc shaped things containing dry powder) in cases of wheezing and running short on breath but I don't recall ever having to be hospitalized for it. 

Over the years I felt the need to use them less to the point I rarely use them anymore. Not because I don't think they work but because I experience the symptoms of asthma very rarely. My mother descibes by case as not severe at all, tho she might've just been trying hard to calm me down. The wikipedia article mentions episodes of wheezing, frequent coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath happening weekly or daily, which doesn't describe my sitiation at all imo. The few times I do remember using an inhaler in the past few years was at times I just felt a bit short of breath and assumed it was inhaler time. They'd be over with very quickly so I might've still been fine without them? It's not like people without any respiratory issues don't ever experience them, right?

I am a male living in the Netherlands (where apparently half of the patients in intensive care are under 50) and according to the covid-19 map there's only 1 confirmed case near me. I don't do any major exercise as of late, only a few push-ups or squats when I feel like it, and I usually avoid dirty air such as people smoking or bonfires, so does that have something to do with it?

47,1584375611,Hereditary_Struggles,I'm a 23 year old woman without a immune system and afraid I won't survive the virus.,"I've had health problems all my life. My body itself is very strong and is very capable of fitting off a lot of shit. My day to day life is living with two rare blood disorders. And because of those beautifully rare blood disorders was the reason for having to have a splenectomy. Living with what I have, I was very aware of what I was getting myself into when having a splenectomy. It wasn't an easy decision but a very necessary one if I wanted a

(semi-normal life).

When I say I was aware of it. I mean since I was 9 I knew the older got the more my spleen would grow and in result would be enlarged. Besides living with the paranoia of my spleen rupturing and spilling out poisonous fluid that would, Oh I don't know... KILL ME if I had any small accident. It was a better health benefit to remove my spleen and live my life without an immune system.

(Because a lot of people don't have immune systems too.) Now obviously I know my body has other ways of fitting off infections and viruses. But It's a year post-splenectomy. And I know my body hasn't fully recovered or developed an immune system on its own. I do everything they tell us when avoiding catching this virus. Stay 6 feet apart, wash your hands for 20 secs and please stop touching your face! But what if that's not enough for me? I'm still just getting myself started in the world and I'm uninterested in stopping my life because of this virus. I already had paused my life for personal family reasons for 2 years and I don't want to let anything else stop me.

Besides me, I do have fear for everyone I know who is either not healthy or older. My mom my grandparents and close friends' parents who I call my second family. And the thought of losing them over this gives me consent anxiety and fear. I love my life right now. It's not perfect by any means. But I have family, friends and my partner who I love and care for with everything I have. My boyfriend who I live with and LOVE SO MUCH has taken so many precautions over this virus. When he's at work he's been staying away from people and keeping his hands clean and sanitized all the time. We have even been spraying our packages that come in the mail with Lysol disinfecting spray. I know he's scared for me. We're both worried about what could happen if this gets worse. There are so many challenging obstacles I have faced and been through growing up that's made me a stronger person. And I know that I am. But I'm struggling in staying positive and not letting this virus take me over mentally. This splenectomy was supposed to better my life but now my worst fear has shown up.

IMHO a decent part of overwhelm in these type of situations can come from feeling like the whole world is coming at you like a freight train, and it's easy to loose track of what specifically needs to be done right now, versus what can be done later.

A tactic I'm doing is to try to maintain laser focus on the best next step at all times. Stocked fridge? Check. Immediate work for this morning? Check. Medication? Not checked... This is going to be my focus for the next few hours. This can help your mind declutter and see the fears and risks more clearly.

I need to be doing something to help, or my mental health will be destroyed. I can’t sit back and do nothing. 

I saw on the news a woman doing grocery pickups free of charge for elderly and disabled. I’ve seen people volunteering to watch kids for families that have to go to work. 

There are certain things I won’t do, like watching children, because of my chronic health conditions. I have autoimmune conditions and I’m not as healthy as my peers (33 years old). With this in mind, what can I do?

I just began sewing masks for myself. I found a wonderful tutorial on using 3m home filters to use in masks. I’ve been told it’s the same material that is used in the 3m n95 masks. I thought I could make masks for those that are compromised and were not able to purchase a N95 mask. But I don’t know how I would reach these people or if they would even want it. 

I have an AA degree in psychology (not much, but it’s something). I try to reach out to people online when I can. Not sure how helpful I am to talk to. But, I am willing to offer my time to people that need some emotional support.

I think doing grocery pickups would be fairly safe for me, if I wore my mask, gloves and goggles. I’m willing to take minimal risks.

This is what I’ve come up with. Any other skills I have are probably useless for this situation. 

Do you have any suggestions for me? I need to help people or I will suffer watching this play out.

60,1584399236,irunfortacos77,"Help with strategies to alleviate feeling ""trapped""","Hi guys!  I have been really struggling with adjusting to life with all of this going on (which is funny because when I give others advice I sound like I'm coping so well, but I'm definitely not!).  I have some mental health issues anyway and wasn't doing too great before this started, but then this kicked up and I spiraled down pretty fast.  I've had a rough last few months and the only thing that got me through was thinking of a big trip I had planned at the end of this month.  Well of course we cancelled, which selfishly I'm distraught about, but more than that is that the sheer panic everybody else and the media is displaying is too much for my already anxiety overloaded mind.  I've completely shut down these last few weeks and the only thing that was keeping me going was going to the gym and movies and my favorite places to eat with friends to get my mind off things. I'm not scared of getting the virus myself like many others are. I'm more worried about my mental health state and how I'm going to get through this.

There was a situation in my life about 6 years ago, would rather not discuss it in detail, but ever since I have had recurring problems where I either feel ""trapped"" and panic or fear being ""trapped"" and panic.  This can be in a variety of scenarios, whether I'm on a plane and they shut the door and push back or if I've just signed a lease for a new apt and started a new job and then feel trapped in the city I'm in with no options.  I remember once I was visiting Florida during a hurricane and everything closed for just a couple days and I panicked in my hotel room because there was nowhere else to go.  Needless to say that isolation is really really really bad for me mentally, and there have been times in the past when I was so depressed I holed up in my apartment, which made everything worse, and I became suicidal.  Now with almost everything closing I feel more trapped than ever and I am concerned about my mental health. Apparently everyone else is too because I couldn't get any appointments to see someone for weeks, which doesn't help too much right now.  I understand why we are doing what we are, but I don't know how I'm going to get through. In the past when I'm mentally pretty rough I've always gotten through by doing things I love like eating at my favorite spots, going shopping, going to the gym, and just going out and being around people so I'm not isolated in my house.  Now I don't even have the options to do that and I'm really worried.  I don't even have anything to keep me occupied during the weekdays, I am in between jobs and was supposed to start my new job last week but of course my start date got pushed back because of all this and now I may not be starting until April-May.

Does anybody have any strategies for maybe overcoming or dealing with these feelings, or things I can still do where I can get out but won't be a risk to others or be violating some sort of restrictions? I'll be in Colorado for the next few weeks so I figured I could go hiking when the weather is nice, but after hearing that Miami closed PUBLIC beaches, I'm terrified they'll take this option away too and close public outdoor space and implement some sort of ""stay inside your home unless you're at the grocery store or else you go to jail"" thing.  I know this sounds selfish right now but I'm pretty worried about myself and I don't know how to get through, and my parents aren't helping much at all.  My friends are all in different states at the moment so I don't have anybody other than my parents to hang out with even at each other's homes and stuff.  Any ideas or coping mechanisms are so appreciated, more specifically to deal with this trapped feeling that I seem especially sensitive to and triggered by.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; struggling not with anxiety about virus itself, but about feeling 'trapped' due to a situation I was in about 6 years ago. ever since have been super panicky any time I feel physically or mentally trapped and it tanks my mental health, which is already shaky. looking for ideas for coping mechanisms or things to do that I'll still be allowed to do that may help. i do know i also need to talk to someone about this, but unfortunately therapists are in short supply it seems when people are panicking and I haven't been able to get an appt.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fju7hh/help_with_strategies_to_alleviate_feeling_trapped/

Typical symptoms...when they start, what they are and how long they last. Like first few days, headache, sore throat, etc. Then the next few days coughing, fever, etc. And so on for the life of the virus.

I know it’s not the same for everyone but something that maps out the life of this thing in an infected person. Somehow it makes me feel better if I know what to look for and what to expect.

I’ve tried searching on Google but most of the GOV sites just give you a generalized outline of the symptoms that I already know. 

Where I live they don’t want to give you a test unless you have some of the symptoms AND have one of the the criteria listed below: 

“You have been exposed to COVID-19 within the last 14 days before your symptoms began, through:
Travel outside of Canada
Close interactions with someone who has COVID-19
Close interactions with someone who has symptoms of COVID-19 and recently travelled outside of Canada or to an impacted area within Canada”

Ok, you know if you have travelled outside your country but how do you know if you’ve been exposed to someone who is infected?? Someone can be infected and not show much of any symptoms. Just like our PM’s wife who said she had a headache and sniffles but got tested anyway and turned out she had the virus. 

My wife has had all of the symptoms for a few days now, except she has only a “low grade” fever, thankfully. People are telling her to get tested but the self assessment web sites say otherwise.

I left on Sunday because of the news of the hotel having only 26 people instead of the 400 they were supposed to have  absolutely scaring the shit out of me, and came home to where I live at the moment with my parents who are over 40, and my mom who Chainsmokes along with my sister. (24)

 I have no clue on what I was thinking and and I'm literally just having panic attacks all day because of this. I'm over sleeping because I don't want any contact with anyone. 
I used to be a heavy smoker mixing cannabis with tabacco but recently stop from respiratory problems that I I knew that obviously would pop up in the future. 

 I'm annoying the hell out of everyone on social media, commenting on the hoaxs and misinformation, notifying my friends the right sources.  Almost getting into arguments with my parents about this.


Seeing people like president of the United States saying that ""this is a bad one, a very bad one"" in no way trying to get on people's political views go from ""it's just a flu"" to ""this is a bad one."" 

I really don't want to increase the anxiety of anybody because of this post I just don't know what to say and I don't know who to talk to you because they all keep saying ""it's just the flu"" exactly how I was like 3 days ago.

How long is it supposed to stay like this? Are people going to stop buying eventually? Or is this it, now? Is it going to be empty shelves and panic stocking until they get a vaccine developed, best case scenario, some time next year?

Does it spread just like a common cold? If I'm generally good at not catching a cold when someone is sick at home, do I have the same chances of avoiding covid 19? I've heard that it's less efficient than the flu at spreading, is that actually true?

What about dishes, how can I make sure that the dishes we use aren't affected? Does it help to wash it with hot water before using it? I wasn't able to find any informations about this other than from blogs and forums that I wouldn't trust.

Last I checked in I ended up talking to 3 doctors who wouldn't test me, but a week later I was still coughing and having trouble breathing which was new, so I called one of the doctors back, who said they would only see me if I was tested lol.

My mom found a place where I could get tested, and it just came back - negative. They gave me a steroid inhaler which has helped my cough tremendously.

&amp;#x200B;

Not an expert here, but it seems like there are 3 possibilities:

a) I got COVID, but since I could not get a tested for 3.5 weeks, it was too late to get results, as my remaining cough was caused my asthma flared up by my irritated lungs.

b) I still have it and the test was a false negative

c) I had some other virus but now my respiratory system is in a weakened state and I should be super paranoid until I recover fully

I just found out that someone from my work tested positive and we were in the building the same timeframe, I'm not sure if I was exposed.

I suppose the smart thing to assume I am vulnerable. The governor closed all restaurants and everyone is working from home so I suppose it will be easier.

Actually it's pretty fucking hard..... If you can do it it will give you something positive to look at.  
Your toughest times in life will give you some of the biggest learning opportunities. Every disappointment and difficulty gives you a chance to learn and grow in some way.  
If you can shift your perspective to look at just one difficult thing you’re facing right now as an opportunity to learn and grow, it can give you a positive silver lining to focus on.

What am I personally grateful for in terms of a learning opportunity? A few things:

* Learning how to stay calm in difficult and uncertain times
* Learning how to work remotely, and away from everyone else (we just got locked down in San Francisco....)
* Learning how to be a better son to my mum and dad, who are half-way across the world in isolation in Australia, by calling them more and not leaving anything unsaid to them

Hope this helps! I encourage y'all to think about what you can reframe as a learning opportunity. Can help you be a tiny bit more positive, which I think we all really need pretty badly atm...

105,1584481593,qdolobp,Questions about specifics and indirect effects,"So I can’t seem to find consistent info anywhere. Asking here to get a general consensus. Going to make it listed because most are unrelated to each other and would be hard to answer in paragraph form on your part:

1. Even though this isn’t that deadly, how ruined is the global economy likely going to be? Everywhere it has hit has seen a massive drop in the economy/stock market. Are we about to hit the greatest recession of our lives?

2. (Assuming we are already on a flat curve) Is it better for everyone to avoid getting it altogether or should people slowly accept getting it? A vaccine won’t be ready for over a year, and it could adapt for all we know. Is it better for people in low risk demographics to expose themselves to it later down the road so they build an immunity? Or is your best bet to avoid it forever?

3. Given how contagious it is, is it safe to assume that 80%+ of people in the infected countries will have it at some point? Or is there a way to fully halt it and let the virus die? Is that too unrealistic?

4. Do you really get sick, feel better, and get sick again? Or is this a myth. I had symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, shakes, headache, dry throat. Now I feel a bit better. I’ve been told it can happen this way and in a few days I’ll feel worse again

5. Will everyone basically go bankrupt? There’s no way everyone will be able to afford rent/bills with no jobs. Even if utility companies are diverting charges, you’ll still have to pay it off eventually, right?

6. How long (in your opinion, obviously you can’t know for sure) until we see the assumed recession end? Will jobs really be that hard to find for a long time? Will the market be down for decades?

7. I know the dangers to high risk groups. But other than that is there any information that is known that is leading to us going full lock down? Obviously it’s common sense to be extremely careful, but assuming I did/do actually have it, it isn’t that bad (knock on wood). I’ve seen so many reports saying it’s not even as bad as the flu.

Yes, the worst case scenario could happen and we could definitely see parts of the U.S. resemble Italy but its important I think to take a step back and realize that we can make an assumption and end up with the opposite.

I work for welfare thus the government where we give info on the corona virus to the population but mostly our mandate is to be the welfare office, we have a public room where our clients are allowed to use the computers. Now I work in a very poor neighbourhood. Poor neighborhood and welfare, that means a lot pf pur clients are homeless people and a lot of them are there just to browse facebook and not do anything related to search of employment (which is the primary reason why we have computers. No one is hiring at this time of the year because literally everything is shutting down where i live. Restaurants, libraries, museums, cinemas, name it.) Ressources are shutting down, they have nowhere to go, so they end up in our office. Not to sound insensitive, but i am exhausted because we are not a damn shelter, and I'm the one who has to keep people from being 1 meter from one to another. Or well i was the one who had to until i complained about it and they called someone from another office to come and do just that. 

They're refusing to shut down that room. Agents working there have the obligation to NOT meet their clients IRL, they are sent over the phone. I MEET THEM IN PERSON, take their documents, interact with them a lot, tell them they need to call their agents because they don't meet the clients anymore. On top of that, i have to go in that room with the computer and help people with their questions and stuff. This room is cleaned ROUGHLY once a day (at the end of the day), and let me tell you, homeless people, as much as i usually love to work with them, don't have the best hygiene in the world. I'm not blaming them, but i'm hypochondriac and I'm trying not to get this damn virus. I now straight up refuse to go in that room. I'm one of the only employees who comes in contact with them, and all of the others are not even allowed to meet the clients. I find this ridiculous that they won't even shut this non essential service when everything is being shut down! Every ressources around have shut down theur public computers. But we don't and the whole logic behind this is ""because the population might come in to get info on the corona virus and they can get it through the computers we have."" NO ONE FUCKING DOES THAT. 

On top of that, my co worker has been coughing like her whole life depended on it. She coughs in her hands a lot of the times and doesn't use wear sanitizer most of the time. I told her she should stay home but she says she's ""not contagious anymore"" (that's fucking bullshit.). I keep telling my boss and everyone but no one seems to give a damn about it since they're not the one working with her. Everyone seems to think I'm overreacting.

The mounting stress of having to deal with all the corona virus related news has started to become too much for me to handle. I have anxiety and this pandemic has taken an extensive toll on my mental health and anxiety. This coupled with the fact that my mother recently passed away due to a genetic lung disease has made me very anxious to go to work and potentially catch the disease from the 200+ employees at the office.

My place of employment has provided paid time off to those that are sick, returning from work or have childcare related issues.  Unfortunately, none of these options apply to me. 

My options are 1 of 3; 

1. Call in sick and use a 1 of the sick days I have left - realistically this will be a short term solution and may provide me with the ability to calm down and get everything together to be able to move on
2. Call in and explain my situation and hope that mental health will be covered as an approved covid related time off
3. Call in sick and tell them that my symptoms are similar to covid-19 - I really would hate to be dishonest as I don't want to panic my colleagues at work and feel that it's morally wrong to do this. 

I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place though because I can't figure out which route to take. I am new at my place of employment and thus don't want to give my managers too much detail about my private life and current mental health struggles.

I wont talk about my feelings on the whole situation cause I'm just as scared as anyone else, but one thing in particular that's been bothering me is seeing reports that the virus has the potential to survive in the air for longer periods of time than they had previously said.

as we know already, the virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets that fall to the ground within minutes. however I've seen some contradictory headlines going around saying that it can stay in the air for longer. thankfully, from what I've read, it seems this is EXTREMELY UNLIKELY to occur outside of a healthcare setting. I'll link one good article about this now instead of a bunch:

https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/

it is highly unlikely for the virus to truly aerosolize in a regular setting or through coughing or sneezing. researchers took samples from the rooms of both symptomatic and asymptomatic covid patients who were almost undoubtedly ""shedding"" the virus and found no traces of the virus in the air or even on most surfaces. more studies have been done that can be seen in that article 

there is also no concrete evidence that the virus is spread by simply breathing that I can find, especially if you are maintaining the 3-6ft rule that you should be.

the times the virus CAN aerosolize are in a healthcare setting such as if someone is on a ventilator or breathing tube, further stressing the need to prioritize masks for healthcare workers. there is also a chance that it could linger in the air in a small enclosed space such as a bus with no ventilation, but this is extremely unlikely to occur either outside or in a large retail store which are almost always well ventilated.

from my understanding which reflects that of the majority of experts I've read, cases of asymptomatic transmission occur through the means of touching a surface an infected person with dirty hands touched, or very close contact etc, NOT simply by them breathing in your direction 

do not let the paranoia of the virus lingering in the air everywhere overtake you. if you stay away from coughing people, wash your hands, dont touch your face, practice social distancing, all the things you already know to do, then you are doing all that you can. there isnt another unknown mode of transmission that you have to worry about.

that being said, it doesnt hurt to approach the air with some caution for peace of mind. for instance at work if I have to walk near a grouping of people I'll briefly hold my breath as I walk by. it's likely reacting to a risk that isnt there but it at least eliminates the paranoia of ""was I exposed when I walked by them"" later. don't walk around holding your breath all the time though :p

I'm in the US but we live in London. 

My paperwork could be coming back anytime between now and April 3rd. As of right now, the processing is still on schedule unless otherwise noted.

We knew the process was going to suck but with impending travel bans, this has turned it into utter hell. With every day that passes and more travel restrictions are discussed and implemented the more I fear that I may not get to see my husband for much longer than we initially expected. What really has me worried is that I have recently seen mentions of lockdowns for up to 18 months. 

So far, both the US and the UK have been terribly slow at taking appropriate action to protect their people, but ultimately, for this sake alone, I hope that they can continue at their current lag solely so that I can make it home... and in terms of contamination... my family and I have been taking precautionary self-isolation measures at home for a while and will continuing to be, and I will be voluntarily self-isolating when I get back to London, in the 12-hour bracket of time that I'd be traveling in full, it would be highly unlikely that I would both pick up, and transmit the disease in that period... so my intent and concern is still obviously to protect others, just to be clear!

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, my visa will come back by the end of this week or the beginning of the next... if that's the case, I'll get on a flight as soon as humanly possible... however once we get closer to April the thought makes me even more nervous. 

I don't know how to cope right now because I really am trying to live day-to-day and not think about problems that I don't have yet. I'm trying to just let it go and not try to control things that are impossible to control. I'm reading, using this time to work on projects that I haven't been able to and won't be able to when I go back to London, etc. I'm at my parents' house and they have a beautiful property so there's a lot to enjoy here. I was even working on reconciling with the idea of dealing with travel bans through May... but when I heard the mention of 18 months my stomach just absolutely dropped.

We were looking at trying to get my husband *here* before the US banned travel from the UK but we were too late... another option could be to book him a flight for April when the ban is set to lift, just in case there's a brief window of time where he can get through... but I just don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I are in our 20s, so health-wise, we're fine. He's working from home and I would be too when I get there so really, neither of us are really concerned about our personal safety. I *am* worried about my parents, my mom is 56 and my dad is 62, they both have health conditions that could be compromising, but they both want me to go back to my husband and see no point in my staying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just... don't know what to do. Thinking about being separated from my husband for over a year is crippling. It's difficult living day-to-day wondering when my passport will show up, and wondering what the next blow is going to be... I can't go on like this. 

Really trying to be cohesive here, but... ultimately I'd really love some advice, and pointers if you have any solid information on these issues at the moment.

last Thursday I developed a scratch in my throat. Stuffy nose, sinuses plugged etc. Didn’t think much of it. Progressed into post nasal drip over the weekend which enhanced the sore throat. Small little coughs maybe 5-10x a day since—Probably because I’m thinking about it and have the scratchy throat. Jittery. Shaky. Tight chest. Most likely anxiety I’m told.

124,1584499250,HarjitGeo3D,The science behind the UK's Coronavirus policy.,"The delay phase of the UK's COVID 19 policy has been one of the most controversial of all the responses to the disease, particularly due to the previous 'mitigation' strategy that appeared to involve deliberately exposing the majority of the healthy population. However, the UK government is apparently shifting to a different strategy (thank god) which, like most of the world, is based around suppressing the initial peak of the epidemic quite forcefully rather than just rounding it off. The study is here:

 [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) 

I'm not an expert by any means, so I'll leave you to judge it. But this is actual science with real models rather than some kind of plot by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson to wipe out all the poor and elderly to save the economy. Some points:

\- According to the models it will be possible to continuously suppress the pandemic at manageable levels all the way through the year by interspersing periods of social distancing with periods of relaxation. This, at the very least, shows that an end-game is being taken into consideration. In fact UK planning seems generally based on long-term expectations that the disease will resurge in the winter months.

\- The models don't seem to factor in the arrival of an effective treatment later this year (very possible), or the possibility of switching over to a contact-tracing based method. Mass surveillance is briefly mentioned as a possibility but not actually factored in either. These could make suppressing later re-occurrences easier.

\- The models do not include mandatory quarantine for the entire population (lockdown). Assumed compliance rates with the voluntary measures in place are given in the report. This should limit the economic damage inflicted by a full lockdown (remember that economic damage can have consequences in lives too), but I think compliance may end up needing to be enforced otherwise fatigue may limit the effectiveness of these measures. Anecdotally a lot of people here outside of London aren't taking things seriously yet, although this is only just the start.

\- The fatality rates given are useful outside the UK context and should be encouraging for those who are panicking over doomsday scenarios. For instance a totally-uncontrolled epidemic in the USA is 'only' expected to lead to the death of 2,200,000 people (510,000 for the UK). Remember that these are not back-of-an-envelope calculations that apply a flat casualty rate over the entire population of the kinds we see from fearmongers, these are the result of simulations carried out by highly-qualified professionals entrusted with guiding government policy.

There are plenty of intelligent and well-educated people out there who can make up their own minds and judge the plans for themselves, but it should be of some reassurance to those who have been stressed out by this unprecedented crisis that at least they exist and are available for scrutiny. I recommend everyone read this paper properly: it was written in language that politicians can understand after all, scientific jargon shouldn't be a big barrier here! :)",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fki9kf/the_science_behind_the_uks_coronavirus_policy/

Truth is i usually am pretty quiet. But ever since panjc has stricken in the country, i have been pretty damn vocal.
I've been very vocal to my boss about how unsafe my position is at work and how it's been putting me at risk. We're having unecessary contacts with the clients who are hanging out in the office (i work in a poor neighborhood and a lot of people coms chill at my workplace even if they shouldn't.) . I've been very vocal to my coworker about how she should sfay the hell home because she's been coughing  like crazy and she's sick despite her saying that ""she's not contagious anymore"" (our job literally pays us if we have symptoma and have to quarantine, she has no reason to be there.)
I am super vocal about everything that i find unsafe and unfair. Which is very out of character for me.

Now, I feel like I annoy everyone and I can't sleep bscause i can't stop playing in my head all the things i have said to other people. I feel annoying and like i'm doing too much. This is a damn pandemic and all the employees are strongly encouraged to not meet their clients, but since i'm at the front desk, i have to be the one literally talking to them on behalf of the people who won't meet them because it is ""unsafe"" for them.

I can't tell what news is real vs what is fake. In terms of medical guidance I'm sticking to the CDC and WHO.

Do I have enough supplies? If I don't, and go to the grocery store, am I going to get infected there?

My parents are both older (70M, 68F). They are divorced and my mom lives alone. She's been taking it very seriously, but I'm paranoid that I might have it and could have exposed her yesterday because instead of waiting for me to go down the stairs during a grocery drop-off yesterday, she opened the door and was *only* 3 ft away from me.

My dad, on the other hand, has been going places and was working in the office up until last Thursday. He's had prostate cancer and is currently on hormones to keep the inoperable shit that's now embedded in his vertebrae from growing. Do these hormones make someone immuno suppressed? And then when I told him I was worried, he said, it's OK, I've lived my life, my affairs are in order, it will be OK. I was like OK but *I* won't be okay!

My sister is a doctor and she's close to the front lines and I can't protect her. So is her husband (my BIL).

My son (13M) is staying with me. At this point I don't want him to go back to his dad's because his dad is being ridiculous and just 2 nights ago told me that he and his wife, along with their 5 yo daughter, are planning in going to Hawaii next month for spring break. WTF. His dad is OK with my son staying here, but I just don't understand why he's not #staythefuckathome (-ing)

Recently even when it was raining and windy, so this just might be a slight cold/flu.

I called my boss today and said that I have a slight cough and something is schratching me from the inside, so I should probably stay at home. Even if it's just a flu, I think it's better to stay at home.

I worry if I go with them, I’ll be stuck for at least 2 months. Maybe more. Could my work start again by then? It stopped last week - tv industry. I’d be stranded if so. Money isn’t a huge issue; moving up in the industry is. 

I’ll also be way more bored. their internet sucks compared to mine (and most people’s). I like online gaming - and it’s a way for me to stay (semi)social. 

Also, they may or may not be moving out of their house in May. They were supposed to move to Europe in April. It’s all up the air on the timing now.

Friends have labelled me ""wacky"" because I care very much about washing your hands regularly, using hand sanitizer in times of epidemics (flu season etc.), but it was always in good fun.

Now, with SARS-CoV-2 going around, I'm scared. I'm a 33yo male, stopped smoking a little while ago, and I'm a Hypertonia stage 2-3 patient — it's a family thing. I take ACE inhibitors as per my GP's advice, but must admit I've been a little lax with adherence lately.

My live-in girlfriend works in a hotel as a receptionist, so in my country (which is in lockdown), she still has to go to work. I'm very worried about her, too, because I love her, because she lives far from home (she's from another country) and her insurance is pretty crappy.

What bothers me most is my current flatmate. He'll move out come end of May, but he's your typical ""it's just a flu, stupid panic everywhere"" person. Never really washes hands, still goes out for parties, has his f\*\*kbuddies over. I asked him to be vigilant due to my condition not to bring anything home, but he still goes to work (currently helping out in construction, moving, wherever he can). His negligence bothers me and I can tell he's starting to think I'm being ""annoying"".

We can't go anywhere else, we don't have the funds to go to a hotel, I can't go to my parents because they, too, need to be isolated. Maybe I am actually overreacting, but I'm worried and this morning I've had the first anxiety attack I've had in a long time, I just couldn't stop crying.

**Killing COVID 19 on surfaces with Rubbing Alcohol.**

I know it needs to be *70 percent Isopropyl Acohol*.   What I am confused about is how long a surface needs to stay wet or  saturated with the rubbing alcohol.   I read on article.. *(Though the source was a dermatologist)* the article said something would need to basically be **soaked in rubbing alcohol for 5+ minutes**.   Is this true?  I have been wiping my counter top with it everyday!  **I  pour it on my counter, then I spread it evenly all over with a paper  towel until the whole counter looks wet with it and then just let it  dry.**... but that doesn't take 5+ minutes?!

Maybe it takes like 1 or 2 minutes to dry usually.?  **Anyways..  am I doing it right? Does rubbing alcohol kill germs and  COVID 19 on  surfaces?  Such as counter tops, light switches, phones, keyboards, etc?**",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fkn4cb/killing_covid_19_on_surfaced_with_rubbing_alcohol/

I have serious health anxiety— my entire life my parents have had rare and extreme illnesses. The good news is they have survived and medical care works! The bad news is that they are at risk and I witnessed their suffering first hand and can’t get it out of my mind. I live in fear of the “mom’s in the hospital” text because I’ve gotten it way too many times.

I’ve mostly been able to set aside my fear about my parents because I don’t live with them, but my husband’s reaction is troubling me. He smokes weed (mostly in joint form) and has for years— he recently took a break while on a job hunt but is back to it. I have been begging him to quit again, even just temporarily for the time being, but he refuses. It melts my brain with anxiety to watch him keep smoking through this. I’m writing this in the middle of the night after waking up after hearing him cough. For the past year I have heard him have breathing difficulties at night and he doesn’t take me seriously because I have such health anxiety and because he loves weed so much.

What can I do? How can I come to peace with this? I can’t stand to potentially watch him suffer extra just because of this stupid habit. I’m so scared for both him and me and wish he could take this as seriously as I need him to.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fkn4va/scared_for_smoking_spouse/

I'm more scared about my parents, who are 60 and diabetic (Dad's a type 2, Mom's a type 1, I'm a type 2), and my grandmother, who is relatively healthy but overweight and 81.

Last week Saturday (Mar 7) I had a bit of a tingly throat and fatigue/light headed. I bounced back remarkably quickly and on Sunday was virtually asymptomatic again other than feeling a little tired. My colleagues had gone to a conference in the US and were also sick - one of them went to get tested and was negative. I told myself this was likely just a case of stress or paranoia and I was totally fine. I had had my flu shots months ago so not the flu. After that my partner got a little ill but I was still fine - he also had a bit of a tingly throat, light headed and fatigue. Within 2 days he was feeling better so we thought ok we just had a mild spell of whatever else was going around (considering there were about 3000 negative tests said the news). I stayed home Monday because I wanted to make sure I was completely asymptomatic before going back to work but didn’t think too much of it because it was literally a one day thing for me.  Tue-thur I went to work and Friday 13 we did a Work from home day and bosses called us to work from home as of then. Weekend and Monday (yesterday) daytime went fine, I went to a few grocery stores but practiced social distancing and used self checkout and sanitized my hand with hand sanitizer after. I also tried cleaning my phone with a wipe and the stores weren’t super busy. However Monday (yesterday) late evening out of nowhere 💥 bam, I was warm, throat was weird again and a big headache. Then, I barely slept and moved to the couch in the middle of the night because I was coughing so much and wanted to be a little upright. This morning I puked up clear fluid first thing in the morning. Now I’m coughing, warm (I don’t know my temperature because I don’t have a thermometer but I’m lightly sweaty and warm not sweating buckets). I am fatigued have slept three times today - at 12, 3 and 5pm. I have a runny nose, it’s difficult to breathe only because my throat feels blocked up - I’ve soaked through five paper towels coughing up clear liquid (thankfully not green or yellow right now) and am having vitamin c and a lot of fluids at home to stay hydrated. I can take a deep breath and my chest doesn’t hurt. I heard Coronavirus was a dry cough which my cough sounds dry like it’s a weak dry cough, not a loud chesty one, but I have so much fluid from my nose and Feels like fluid in my throat.

I honestly don’t know what to do like I don’t want to be a burden on the health system as I’m fairly young but I also want to know so I can contact people who I worked with and or stress the importance if I do indeed have it. I’m otherwise relatively healthy - non smoker or vape, low bp, suspected Early onset RA - still doing follow ups for that but nothing diagnosed), I take vitamins daily like zinc and vitamin c and d as well as fish oil capsules, No kidney, liver, thyroid issues. 

We do have assessment centres now but I don’t even know how I’d get there I have no car and wouldn’t want to call a taxi or uber and get anyone sick. I could take the train and try and stay far away from people. I also have to be online for work though. I’m so confused with what to do - what would you do?!

It's very possible. That's how this thing traveled so quickly.

You have to remember that the network of humans touching each other is simply the landscape for a virus. It's like it's spreading in a petri dish - we are all links in a chain that can only separate from each other with EXTREME effort. And to coordinate this among so many people is incredibly ambitious, and complicated. Because we exist in a network. This has very little to do with you, individually.

To clarify: you MUST do your part to break the chain of transmission, and I would guess that 99% of the people reading this are already quarantining to the highest degree they are able, given the very hard decisions people have to make regarding pay and social connections. We are all doing the best we can.

2 weeks ago I went to a couple Jazz games (where the virus started in the NBA). On Saturday I flew to Las Vegas for a party, then flew to Los Angeles and ran the LA marathon on Sunday and went surfing in Santa Monica the same day. On Monday I went surfing in Huntington Beach, walked down 2nd street and hiked signal hill. Tuesday I went to DisneyLand. Wednesday I flew back to Las Vegas because COVID was really blowing up and I knew it would be empty, I walked around and went to the theatre to watch birds of prey. I flew back to LA to go to Universal Studios with some friends on Thursday. And Friday I hiked up to the Hollywood sign then went to Venice beach and played basketball/worked out at Venice Beach with them then we went to 3rd St. Promenade to finish the day.

Friday was my first day of showing symptoms, I had a slightly dry throat but I dismissed it because I was thinking I must've drank a little too much saltwater while surfing so I just drink an extra bottle before I go to bed and everything would be cool.

Saturday I flew back to school from LAX which probably didn't help, but I had woken up with the worst sore throat I had ever felt. Luckily I live alone in my dorm so I quarantined myself. In my dorm I have a lot of Gatorade, cliff bars, and other sports nutrition and I will say room temp Gatorade seriously helped my sore throat. By the end of the night I was feeling kind of cold making me think I had a fever which I fixed it by turning up my room temp to 80.

I woke up Sunday with my throat feeling even worse and I noticed after I got out of the shower I could see my hair steaming in the mirror making me know I had a fever. I also had diarrhea Saturday which I can't even remember when the last time I had diarrhea was so I finally told myself that there was a good chance I got the virus.

On Monday I wanted to go biking or for a run, and I did a relatively light workout for me but pretty shortly I was feeling fatigued and my throat was hurting so bad I was getting hard to breathe. I was having a bunch of dry coughs as well so I called it quits and decided to drink more Gatorade and take a nap. I stayed pretty inactive the rest of the day, you know just YT, Netflix, seeing how much homework I had to do and I had more diarrhea throughout the day.

Tuesday I woke up with my eyes feeling pretty puffy, they were kind of red in the mirror and I figured it was because my temperature was very high. I also had a slightly queasy tummy. However there was good news, my throat was feeling much better, probably the same or slightly better as Saturday. My diarrhea was gone but that stuff wasn't fully solid either. While I was in bed I realized how hot I was so I slept with no blankets.

Today my throat feels totally fine and my hair no longer steams when I get out of the shower so I think my fever is gone. It's also around 1pm and I haven't coughed at all. I ran 5 miles but my muscles and bones still kind of ache so I took it easy, other than that I feel normal again. In my experience it took about 5 days from getting the symptoms to getting over them. Today I'm going to just disinfect everything in my room so I don't get it again if that's even possible.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fku986/recovering_from_covid/

She says she feels safe going out to meet a friend, and she's getting pissed because I told her I'd rather we don't meet for now.

I might be ok meeting her if she's been taking this as seriously as I am but if she's out taking the subways etc, this would make me feel even more anxious about meeting her. She's in the Bronx, I live in Queens.

Our job is 100% done on the computer, through a virtual network. My boss laughed when my coworker said she was given the message to tell her we want to work from home. Boss said, ""Well good luck with that!""

They sent out an email yesterday saying anyone who had the ""ability"" to work from home would have to do so starting Monday. It was signed with our immediate boss's name, her supervisor, and a few others.

Our immediate boss emailed us, didn't even come out of her office to talk to us about it, saying that this only applied to departments where they already had the ability to work remotely - - not us. She didn't even apologize, just said to wash our hands and wipe down our desks. She said we would be ordering disinfecting wipes as if that would solve all of our problems.

One lady came back from a cruise on Tuesday. She apparently ""didn't know"" she was supposed to self-isolate. Now she's gone for two weeks. Lot of good that does now. Another coworker just got back from Miami today.

I called out today because this whole situation has made me a nervous wreck. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I've been nauseated. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Is there anything I can do? My boss just got back on Monday from a bike event in a decent-sized city in our state (that was apparently canceled yet these idiots decided to gather anyway) so I'm kind of afraid to even go in her office to tell her how I feel.

I have mild asthma. My mom has high blood pressure, history of stroke, chronic pain, and my dad will be 60 this year. I still live with them. This is a recipe for disaster.

She is experiencing back and possible nerve issues in her leg. She is young 29. I’m a little older. 34. Both in good health (other than my anxiety, hypochondria, and OCD). My counseling and psychiatrist appointments have been moved to online/phone formats because of the number of cases jumping in my area (upstate NY). My wife isn’t concerned and wants to go to the Dr to get herself checked out, as she should. From Friday-Sunday I had a terrible sore throat (post nasal drip) and chills. Me we a fever and even now the sore throat is mild. I’ll get chills if I think about. Xanax has been too good a friend the last couple days but has been necessary to function. I’m sure just a cold/sinus thing but can’t help thinking it’s the virus. I’m Slowly improving. bNeedless to say I scheduled an apt right after my wife’s. I’m sure they won’t test me, as I doubt they even have any. I guess I’m just wondering if I should call first thing tomorrow morning to see if they offer telemedicine instead or if it’d be better to talk to the dr before going in and risking exposure. Chances are the dr is going to send her to get imaging anyways so now that’s 2 points of exposure in offices  instead of potentially 1 if it can be done via phone. Am I over reacting and should just go to the dr and get it over with or does the phone thing make sense?

I CANT DO THIS.

another thing is that i would've liked to continue the school year but with how it's looking now i fear that the rest of the school year might be cancelled and i won't be able to go to school until august. hopefully it won't, right now the governor of my state has it closed till april 28, keeping my fingers crossed it doesn't go longer.

203,1584584513,snailgorl2005,I'm trying to stay hopeful through this,"Let me start off by saying: I am *very* optimistic, to a fault. I have diagnosed anxiety and depression and what has made me so resilient is that I somehow manage to keep optimistic through even the darkest times.

This is the first major event that I have personally been involved in that I will be able to remember well (I'm 24, turning 25 at the end of the year, for reference)- I mean, it's hard not to be since it's so widespread. I have been going through phases of denial, anger, stress, and optimism, sometimes all within the same time. My entire life was cancelled within a 48 hour period of time. I know that it's not the worst thing that could happen- it's honestly better for everyone. I'm dealing with grief, frustration, and boredom, just as most are right now.

My biggest source of anxiety is mostly from other people. I have seen so much pessimism, so many ""real"" comments from people who are feeling the same way as I am, and it's honestly disheartening. I personally believe that this kind of negativity is going to hinder the development of a cure/treatment or learning more about this strain of the virus. It's to the point where I'm starting to lose hope about this ever being over. I want to be able to enjoy my 25th birthday.  I want to be able to see my friends soon. I want to be able to go back to work. The more hope we have, the more we can slow the spread, the more we can start to return to normal life.

But with all the negativity I see, it's making me doubt everything I believe in. It's making me feel like I'm wasting my time trying to stay positive. What made it worse is that I saw a tweet, liked by some of my own friends, criticizing people who were upset that things were cancelled for them. It made me feel like I'm not valid for crying because I have nothing to look forward to right now. I have staying home and I have Master's coursework to finish.

I have an appointment to donate blood on Friday since there's a shortage in my county. I've been making plans to contribute toward groups I am a part of that have had to cancel fundraisers due to the outbreak.

I would love to do more to help while having to isolate, but I'm limited in my options right now, and with everything going on I feel hopeless.

204,1584584912,StuckUndrTheBridge97,"I started SSRIs, had a breakup, and started a new job- then I got quarantined. It's killing me.","I was only on my new job for 2 weeks when I learned that I was in close contact with a confirmed patient and had to go into quarantine. 

The stress of having to do a job I'm still not quite sure how to do on my own, with no coworkers to ask for help, on sub-par technology, and still being expected to deliver the same level of service, is debilitating. Our clients aren't understanding at all and have been incredibly rude and abusive to me over phone and email. I just want to cry every time they call me. I'm worried my work may lay me off in the upcoming recession or that I'm doing such a bad job they'll just outright fire me. 

I'm getting all kinds of weird symptoms from starting SSRIs, and every small thing sends me into a panic now because I'm not sure if it's a symptom of COVID-19. I also don't know if my state is going to go into a lockdown, if my grandparents will be ok, when I can see them again, etc. I haven't gotten more than 5 hours of sleep in a week. 

I'm stuck inside with my parents and I've been extremely unhappy and lonely, which isn't helping with the sense of loneliness you get after a breakup. I can't see any of my friends or go anywhere. 

This has been the worst month of my life and I'm trying so hard to keep it together. My birthday was a two weeks ago and I thought that was a turning point in the depression I've been feeling, but I ended up getting exposed to a confirmed patient at the bar I went to to celebrate and didn't learn until 5 days later, and it's all just been downhill from there. My parents are both out of work. My friend is in the hospital with a suspected positive case. Everything is shutting down and the economy is tanking. 

I'll make it through this but this has been one of the darkest months of my life and I know it's going to get worse. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare sometimes and wish I'd wake up from it.

I'm someone who goes stir crazy really fast when indoors, and I've been dealing lately by going on a lot of walks. I don't run into a lot of people, so theres by far more ""social distancing"" than at, say, my job (grocery store) or even in my house sometimes. (I have a bedroom and bathroom to myself but I do have roommates).  

But I worry that it still wouldn't be allowed, or it would be limited, or people would look at me like I was doing something forbidden/wrong. And especially with the weather getting nicer, being outside and moving around is one of my number 1 coping methods (second being phone calls, which I usually also do while walking- more privacy than in my house).

It’s well north from where I live so while I knew it was a bit closer to home now, I thought I’d be okay for a minute. 

I commute to work and work an hour and a half away from home. I work in a hospital but not as a nurse or anyone with direct patient contact. Today we got word that a new case has been confirmed in the county where I work. 

My fiancé and I live together and are extremely close to his parents. We’ve all been preparing as well as we can over the past several weeks. He’s been telling me that eventually there are going to be programs and such in place to protect people that can’t work or have to isolate due to the virus, but since these confirmed cases are brand new for us we haven’t heard anything official about them and don’t know if or when we will. 

Since I now work in a “hot zone,” he wants me to stop going to work. And from a safety standpoint, I am all for that. I don’t work with patients myself but it’s still right on top of me now, and while my fiancé and I are both young and healthy, neither one of us want to risk passing anything on to his parents. 

But I am extremely concerned about the financial aspect. My fiancé is still working for now but there’s a very real possibility his workplace could close down soon. We have some money in savings but I don’t know how long we can stretch it out. We’ve heard rumors about payment of rent and bills not being enforced until the worst has passed but they’re still rumors at this point. And that $1000 per household from the government that’s apparently possibly coming is still a couple weeks out and that’s not even a sure thing.

My job isn’t the kind that I can do from home. I have some PTO saved up but depending how long this goes on I’ll likely exhaust it all and I’ll have nothing coming in after that. I have no idea what I’ll do for money and I am freaking out.

I'm also starting to become concerned about rumors regarding the U.S. enacting militarily-enforced lockdown. In the event this happens, when we reach the point here in Mexico where things are quite bad, it may mean that we're unable to return to the U.S.

My heart breaks every time I read about people who are extra vulnerable during this crisis. 

Elderly people who have little to no contact with their families - everyday they are getting more lonely now that their daily activity clubs are cancelled.

People without a proper home, without proper means to protect themselves. Homeless people - many of them are at high-risk due to health problems, and on top of that  many have mental health difficulties.

Refugees living in illegal tent settlements - almost no acces to clean water, and no ways to self isolate, no place to stay when you're sick..

(Sorry if this is depressing, I thought about removing this part, but I also want to illustrate why I exactly feel so hopeless). 

I can't think of ways to help these people. I am doing all I can think of. My husband and I offered to help an elderly woman who lives nearby: we call her often and will do her grocery shopping for her. I call my grandma often. I am planning to write greeting cards to the elderly people who live in a retirement home nearby.

I am prone to feeling useless. I am unemployed due to health reasons at the moment and society in general views unemployed people as useless and I sometimes internalise this. 
And the urge to be useful in order to be ""allowed to take any space"" and ""to be accepted"" is a huge theme for me emotionally / connected to complex trauma. I know it is also important that I take care of myself, as someone who deals with mental health problems (complex trauma), and as someone who at this moment is feeling ill since about 1,5 week (possibly covid-19: there are a lot of cases in my neighbourhood,  my husband and I both have all the symptoms and friends are also ill, or possibly another virus). These things I must admit and add to my story, although I hate the fact that I am making it all about me at the moment, when so many people have it it way worse.

237,1584627465,HearIAm07,Should I stay at my mom’s house or go back to my apartment?,"Hi, I need some advice. I am a 23F in the US who is currently on spring break from grad school. I came back to my mom’s house for break and have been staying here, self-isolating, but still in contact with my mom and my grandpa.

Since classes have moved online, I was planning to stay with family at least another week or so after spring break. However, now that s**t has really hit the fan, I am wondering if it is safer for me and my family to be apart. 

My mom could potentially expose me to COVID-19 because she is a pharmacist and still has to work a lot despite the current situation. Although she washes her hands a lot &amp; I wipe everything down, we live in a small house and still share a lot of things. On the flip side, if I somehow have it/get it, I would be exposing her and my grandpa, who are both 60+ :((( 

I have an apartment back at school where I live with a roommate, but we have separate rooms and bathrooms. I can easily self isolate there, but it’s a large apartment building so I’d have to use the hallway, door, elevator, etc. that hundreds of others use. While I don’t plan on going out much, I still want to go for walks outside and go get my mail, take out the trash, etc. Not to mention that I heard the virus can maybe be spread through plumbing in the building???? :(( 

It sounds safer for ME to go back to my apartment probably.... But in this difficult time, I’d like to be with family. AND if I’m not there to take care of my grandpa, my mom (who is still at work in contact with the public!) will still be going over to cook him meals and keep him company. I’m just at a loss - I know I’m still young and healthy, so i’m trying to think of what is best for my family, but I also have health anxiety &amp; don’t want to expose myself to the virus either.

240,1584630206,TurquoiseSucculents4,How’s that history major looking now?,"I’ll admit, I used to wonder what one did with a bachelors in history. Outside of higher studies, that is. Now, I can see a huge use for historians. This whole fucking thing could have MAYBE POSSIBLY been avoided with the help of historians. 

Think about it. An accomplished history major, who’s studied events like the bubonic plague and the Great Depression. And studied the nuances and circumstances surrounding that time. As well as resources available back then. It would be so easy to collaborate with, say, the public health department, a medical team, the stock market, and ask them questions about how they would have used current resources to avert that crisis. And use that in helping avert the next crisis.

The main question would be “knowing what you now know about the societies victims to this pandemic were in, what would you have done differently, assuming all current technology and medical/healthcare resources are available to utilize?” This allows history to play a role in coming up with a feasible and effective solution to avoid repeating the same mistakes as back then. Even if it took years to implement because no such crisis to apply it to, it’s still handy to have sitting there for when the time comes. If people had been doing that all these years, and adding onto this grand plan, maybe it could have motivated scientists to develop more advanced medical technologies.

Same with the stock market, “knowing xyz about society back then and knowing what’s different now, what would you differently to avoid this economic crisis?” And yet more innovative business ideas to build upon over the years and stow away for the foreseeable future until the time comes to deploy that plan for when the next financial/economic crisis hits. 

But this feels like wishful thinking. Nobody will ever take history seriously as a “useful” subject like math or science. And I wish we could change that.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/flbggf/hows_that_history_major_looking_now/

242,1584631637,StarryStudent,Currently abroad and afraid I won't get home.,"I'm currently in Israel and planning on flying out to the US very early morning next Tuesday. I was studying at yeshiva (a religious school to study Torah and other Jewish things) and decided to leave early.

I'm absolutely terrified that my flight will get canceled or, God forbid, the airport will be closed. 

This very likely is not going to happen, but I'd already been having a miserable time in Israel without the help of the stress and anxiety brought on by Covid. I'm just so afraid that my efforts to leave this country are going to fail and that I'll be stranded here until God knows how long. It's caused a number of breakdowns. 

As an aside, another stressor I have is that I'll get sick before next Tuesday and have to be quarantined here for two weeks, to then try to get another ticket home, and continuing the cycle of being afraid that it will get canceled.

245,1584633806,JaimeLeCafeNoir,Frenchman on lockdown. Starting to feel relaxed.,"Hi everyone, hope you're all fine!

As you know, my country, France, is now on complete lockdown since Tuesday at noon. Nothing really interesting to read here but I just wanted to talk about  my new ""lockdown routine"" and how I'm starting to feel more relaxed each day.

It was the strangest feeling I ever felt in my entire life, seeing our President saying those words six times on TV: ""We're at war."" Half of the population saw this live: an absolute record. Hearing the fact that the next day at 12am everyone will be on lockdown. Just imagine for a second what we all felt. My heart was beating like crazy, my wife was completely silent, we stayed in front of the TV, speechless, listening to this, imagining what will come next, preparing for the worst. We knew for a fact that lockdown would happen like in Italy but, when you hear it live on TV, it's completely different. Will there be riots in grocery stores? Wait how long? It's ok don't worry! Will we see the army on our streets? Are the shops going to be closed? We'll be okay! Wait. Is this it? Are we really living this? You name it. It was really something.

The first day of lockdown, some people (of Paris mainly, sadly) rushed to big train stations, wanting to get out of their big cities before lockdown, not listening to the fact that we SHOULDN'T go out at all costs. They were all packt like sardines in a crushed tin box. They probably made the biggest mistake of their life and everyone in France was really shocked, but, yup, only time will tell. 

Two days on lockdown passed by. We're at home with my wife. Of course, we're not able to see our friends, to see our families, our neighbors, to go at the park, to do anything  beside doing ""essential"" groceries, go to the pharmacy or walk around our house. We can't go out unless it's an absolute necessity. And if we want to do so, we have to print an official paper, date it and sign it, in case of control by the police (we don't have a printer at home so we have to copy it by hand, a bummer, plus we have to copy ALL of it word for word, a normal process in order to discourage people). Needless to say it was a bit strange getting out the first time for some grocery shopping, the atmosphere was almost Half-Life 2-esque. I talked with the manager of my local shop that I know very well, and she's doing ok, I don't know why but it warmed my heart talking to her and her husband. I saw social distancing on the streets but honestly it didn't felt *that* apocalyptic, just different.

Now, we try to read the strict minimum of news, just staying informed of important things. I completely stopped reading Reddit hours a day, scrolling furiously r/coronavirus and others, putting my phone down at 4 am falling asleep completely exhausted. I just stopped doing this. My anxiety was too high and I thought: what's the deal? What's the point? My life is right here, right now, in this house. Nowhere else. I just need to keep being informed of important things, and nothing else. It was hard to stop but, it was necessary. 

Now for the good news. Honestly, lockdown is something but it's not *that* bad. The weather is absolutely beautiful over here, 20 degrees C (68F) and a blue sky. Instead of worrying all the time about the end of the world as 1/2 comment on some subs and forums says on Internet, we're just doing normal or wholesome things. Well, beside the fact that my delivery of Animal Crossing I ordered a week ago appears to just be stopped somewhere, everything is fine. In the morning, we watch cartoons like we were kids, some Pokémon, eating our breakfast and coffee. Rest of the day we're working and listening to some music. We were never fan of working before (attention: kids are living inside our 30 year old heads) but honestly, it feels very good, thinking about your work, being focused, and feeling accomplished at the end of the day. Our flat is very small but whatever, we actually don't care that much. We play some Stardew Valley, too. Some Rocket League. Some Zelda. We have to be together and move on together and keep fucking hope, like what's written on Trunk's time machine. [Hope](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkSnAX8WkAM_lPH?format=jpg&amp;name=large). Tonight we'll re-watch some Ghibli films. Can't wait.

Yesterday night, we drank some beers on our balcony (thanks to our neighbors that handed us a table and two chairs because our balcony should have been under repair this month, and we sold everything two weeks ago, bummer). Everyone was drinking at their own balconies or gardens, it was actually pretty funny (we're living in the suburbs of Bordeaux). We talked with our neighbors from afar. People we never even saw or talked with before. One of them even played guitar for us all, asking what we wanted to hear. So simple, yet so relaxing. At 8 pm, EVERYONE clapped their hands (to thank the workers of the medical field). So heartwarming too. 

Yesterday night was a good night and so is today. So. Silent. No city sounds, just birds chirping. It's weirdly relaxing. It was a long time since I heard birds from my apartment. It's so cool. I tried to recognize which sound corresponded to which bird but it's VERY hard actually. I waved at my neighbors from afar, thing I never did before. We smiled at each other like hey, you're also wearing pyjamas? A kid was playing with a Switch (or was it a Game Boy Color? No way) in a garden. I don't know. I felt cool.

Well, yes, we're living something we only saw in things like SF films or games like The Division. Yeah it's very impressive. We know. But I firmly believe that even if it's gonna be some hard confined months ahead, we'll be somehow okay. We'll find a way. Take advantage of this quarantined time to focus on what matters the most in your life. Oh and unsubscribes from r/collpase and r/coronavirus, instead sub to r/wholesome or I don't know what you like the most. Or do something else. Write me a message if you feel stressed. I'm an asthmatic, maybe we can talk about this? I don't know. I love video games, if you want to talk about this. 

Well. We will saw nice things coming from all this. I can feel it. Honestly we're starting to feel relaxed. We have no choice but getting through this. Stay safe everyone!",/r/COVID19_support/comments/flcg6s/frenchman_on_lockdown_starting_to_feel_relaxed/
246,1584637222,tootsdafroots,"Panic versus taking action, staying calm versus sticking your head in the sand, how do we maintain balance and make appropriate decisions?","I want to ask about knowing when to act versus when to stay calm... ultimately both should be done simultaneously but the 'taking action' part usually coincides with a level of panic or anxiety.

I mean more of when we should listen to our anxiety and take the actions that are available to us and not interpreting the 'stay calm' message as in invitation to put our heads in the sand - like a lot of people around me seem to be doing.

For instance, actions that are within our control:

* If you're sick, even mildly, taking steps to get tested - rather than thinking that *your* illness, no matter how mild, couldn't possibly be COVID-19 and therefore ignoring it... when right now it seems important that, even if you'll be fine at home, helping to get accurate numbers seems important
* Taking the highest measures you can for social distancing - a lot of people around me seem to think that because *we* haven't been ordered to do things in the same way that China or Italy has... that it for some reason means that we don't or won't have to
* Leaving the city if you have the option to - Now this is a big one for me. A loved one of mine is currently in a city that is heading towards lockdown, even though they're assuming there won't be travel restrictions, I think that it's ignorant to rule it out as a very real possibility - it seems like if you have the means to leave, a car, can travel safely by taking measures to protect yourself and those around you, have a parent or friend outside of the city that you can stay with, it seems like a good idea and an action that *can* be taken.

These are my opinions... and I'm starting to feel incredibly frustrated with those around me who would rather just 'meditate and wait and see what happens' when what happens could be detrimental or too late to exercise the options that were initially available.

These are such confusing times and it's easy to feel helpless because a lot of things are out of our personal control, but even when it comes down to things like getting food, my family is still only buying enough to last a week because they think all of these options will still be available to them the next.

247,1584640701,sassylildame,I Feel Lost. TW: Ideation,"I'm posting this here bc all the rant pages like ""off my chest"" and ""unpopular opinion"" won't let you post about COVID19, they just stick them on these megathreads where it gets lost and I feel even more lonely and unheard and suicidal so I'm sorry if this comes across as angry but I'm really freaking angry and scared shitless. 

I feel like every single time I post something on fb along the lines of ""stop shaming people for leaving their house when they can't work from home"" or ""service/arts/entertainment workers whose jobs were just cut have the right to be upset"" someone always comments something like ""it's not about you"" or ""people are dying"" or ""it's about society's most vulnerable"". Or ""social distancing may be a long term thing and we'll all just have to adjust"".

Like, um NO. How about you STOP. Unemployment in the USA just reached 20% a few days ago. Do you know how high that is?! During the Recession of 2009 it was 10%. WE'RE DOUBLE THAT!! During the Great Depression it was 24%. We are SO CLOSE TO BEING THERE and if/when retail shops all close WE WILL BE THERE!! Guess what--during the great depression there wasn't a virus going around, but a lot of people died because they KILLED THEMSELVES. Or STARVED TO DEATH. Because they had NO MONEY. But screw anyone who cares about that/them, right?! I mean SCREW THEM.

In what ridiculous opposite land universe are people living paycheck to paycheck, on jobs that don't have paid leave, not considered some of ""the most vulnerable among us""?! This ""the poor must starve so the elderly can live"" bullshit is UNBELIEVABLY inhumane (yes, I know it doesn't just affect the elderly but service/gig workers are still supposed to ""adjust"" to not having jobs anymore). Guess what, Karen, with your cushy white collar 9-to-5 that lets you work from home and gives you health insurance and your husband and kids and pets that give you additional support you get to stay at home with--GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE.

2% of the US population versus 20% of the US population--TEN TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE are at risk of starving to death as will suffocate to death over the next year. And gun to my head? I'd rather suffocate. By far. None of this is to say we shouldn't be concerned about the elderly and immunocompromised, we should, but myself and all of my friends are young, healthy, creative gig workers who up to one month ago had beautiful bright futures ahead of them and expected to live a long time. Literally everyone I consider a close friend is, sorry WAS, in food service/arts/entertainment. And everyone, save one person, lost their jobs. I'm lucky. I come from a line of good, highly educated New York Jewish stock, and though I'm financially independent I have backup if I need it. Most of my friends aren't so lucky. And I worry about them dying, but not from coronavirus. 

For that matter, I don't do well in isolation. At all. I know I'll kill myself if there's a lockdown and I have to live alone in my apartment for more than 3 days--all my roommates are home with their families, and my mom wants me home because she knows I'm like this. But my sister and dad are immunocompromised and my sister also has asthma and I've only been social distancing for like 3 days, in Manhattan of all places. I can't risk it. And every time I'm on social media it's people just being MEAN and HATEFUL. The irony is, I know I'll get COVID19. I know I'll survive. Because I'd really be fine with dying and that's how the universe works. I feel so lost. 

I think if one more person says ""people are dying"" to me after I've been sobbing and shaking nonstop for 4 days, I'm gonna slice up my arm. Or hang myself. I'll have plenty of time to refine the plan. Because even when there isn't a pandemic, I think about people I care about dying every single day. It's like a constant thought. It's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm supposed to turn 27 in early June. I probably won't make it that far. And I feel selfish even thinking all of this.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/flegtv/i_feel_lost_tw_ideation/

I woke up, and I was ok anxiety-wise, but normal life, messes, and fighting children started to chip away at the good attitude that I was determined to have when I posted yesterday. It makes me sad that my kids are starting to feel cooped up. The weather isn’t good where I am, so I can’t even get them in the backyard to feel like they aren’t imprisoned. 

Admittedly, our basement is a bit of disarray. You know, it’s the spot in the house that accumulates the stuff you really don’t need, but can’t bare to part with just yet. In addition to the junk, there are the Holiday decorations. I really had the best intentions of tackling the basement during this time to further assist in keeping busy, but I felt like my kids needed somewhere to cut loose. So we worked for an hour moving all of the random things in the basement to the smallest part of the basement so the kids could utilize the space to ride bikes and trikes (it’s an unfinished basement). The loved it!! 

I really wished I could’ve had the project to organize the basement during this time, because I think it would’ve aided me in my anxiety, but I realized as my kids were fighting over who was looking at whom over breakfast this morning, that maybe they are also anxious of the situation...though they may not fully understand it.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/flg1be/salvaging_a_day_with_a_rough_start/

But we will still get through this. I have a sister who lives and teaches in Moscow, she is now at home and has moved all courses to be online for the next 6 weeks. Russia is a country that lost 27 million its own citizens fighting a far more evil and cruel force than the coronavirus.

256,1584655160,tootsdafroots,How do I get my family to cooperate?,"I'm 24, staying at my parents' house - my mom is absolutely refusing to take serious measures and is inconsiderate to my father and I. 

My father is 62 and has acute adult asthma, also sleeps with a CPAP. Since beginning working at home, his asthma has actually gotten worse due to environmental allergens, which he was far away from in his air-circulated city office.

My mom is 57 and has CLL, which is a benign form of leukemia... like it's so benign that she's probably safer having it because the periodic testing to make sure that it's in check would highlight if she had any other cancers occurring. Her condition is in good form and her doctor has even recommended getting tested less. Either way, it's still a condition, I wouldn't want to couple it with COVID 19.

My mother also has a persistent ongoing cough... thing that she has had for years - not COVID 19. However, due to it being ongoing and not contagious, she has developed bad habits in the form of making no effort to cover her mouth when she does it, just gagging directly into the open air. 

She begins every single morning by blowing her nose, not washing her hands, coughing on everything, and getting hysterical when I ask her to be more considerate.

My mother has always been immature but the degree of disrespect that she's displaying right now is, frankly, insane. 

I've calmly asked her on multiple occasions to at least get into the habit of being more careful since, if she were to pick up the virus, she would be spreading it even before she was symptomatic, especially with her coughing condition.

She has also been insistent on going out and seeing neighbors with the dog. Right now, it doesn't seem like pets can get it but they can act as surfaces. Thing is some neighbor's spouses are still going to work every day, even though they're outside and 'being careful' I just don't think this is a good situation and brings on too many unknowns. 

My mom hasn't been good about washing her hands, her phone, containing her own conditions... therefore I don't think it's fair for her to even be venturing out... we can't trust her. 

My dad agrees with me but said he gave up trying to get her to do anything differently 35 years ago because she just doesn't listen.

Last night we were sitting around the kitchen table and my mom openly coughed several times. I looked at her calmly and asked her why she continues to do it, why she can't just contain it, that it's disrespectful to the rest of us. She responded by standing up, coughing openly into the air, and storming out the door.

I literally don't understand. I just don't. I've spoken with her calmly about it. Explained how it affects us, how she needs to get into the habit of being safe, to consider my father, etc. That if she can't contain it she needs to stop going out, period.  My father and I have even briefly discussed telling her to leave... which obviously isn't something we want at this time and need to be together as a family. 

Every time I bring this up she throws her hands into the air and storms off, interrupts me, plugs her ears and doesn't listen, or just coughs onto things to prove some kind of a point.

She doesn't have COVID 19 yet... but if she gets it she's going to forcibly give it to all of us, and my father who is at risk for serious complications. 

What do we do in this case?",/r/COVID19_support/comments/flir5b/how_do_i_get_my_family_to_cooperate/

262,1584670433,wrtics,So worried about my family of lifelong smokers,"My mum is a mental health worker and brilliant at it, her workplace are going to start staff ""working from home"" by Monday, but she's working all weekend. Even then, they will still be going on visits to patients in their homes all across the city daily, then just coming home instead of the office to write notes and fill out forms (that's basically all her job is). So, even though it's good that they're doing this, she's still going to be coming in contact with so many people every day - even people in self isolation!

 I'm so worried about her. She doesn't seem to be that concerned and said she's okay with the thought of getting the virus, and would even volunteer to stay in the office to upload documents and continue working there. 

I know I have to respect her wishes for dealing with this however she sees fit, as she knows much more about her work than I do. But I'm still really scared for her. Other than being a lifelong smoker, she is pretty healthy and never gets sick, so that's making me feel a little better. I'm more concerned that she lives completely alone, so I really dont want her having to isolate by herself incase she gets really ill and there's no one there to phone an ambulance. 

My grandfather is also in self isolation because of age and pre-existing health conditions (also a smoker!), and my mum is the only one who can drive to take him supplies that he needs. We don't really have any other family.

Some really hard decisions are going to have to be made, like whether or not I should go there and isolate with her if need be, or whether we should just avoid each other entirely, so I can try and help my grandfather if I have to. I'm also a slightly higher risk because of unexplained lymphocytosis. I just really don't know what decisions I should be making right now.

269,1584673926,BoneclawWalker,Under $50 Nonperishable Pantry Shopping list,"Hi, I grew up with hippie activist parents, and we were low-key preppers. Because of this I have done zero shopping for the COVID19 pandemic. We just already have everything on hand.  


To try and help people, I wanna share how we live at my house, and how we shop.   


Step 1 - don't freak out and go grab everything all at once. The supply chain in most places is not screwed yet, there will be food arriving for quite some time. It also promotes un-needed panic to see carts overflowing with hoarded food and empty shelves. ""Why should I care if I get mine...?"" Well because if you provoke a panic in a grocery store, you may NOT get yours. Also, if others panic and go into selfish mass hoarding mode, there may be no ""yours"" left to get!  


Step 2 -instead budget between $5 to $20 each shopping trip. In our city most places stock overnight and get raided like crazy in the morning. So plan to send a family member as the store opens, before work. Each of you can prevent panic-provoking by splitting up and checking out separately. So if you want 5 bags of dry beans, you get 2 and your spouse gets 3 in a different line. Please be socially conscious and do this, it really does help.   


Step 3 - each shopping trip, have 2 lists - one of the perishable things you'll use in the next week, and a ""stock up"" list that you won't use at all, until needed. Budget that extra $10 or so, to grab stuff on the stock-up list.   


Step 4 - here's what we keep on hand, as a general rule. ! gallon cooking oil, one can crisco, one box iodized salt. Assorted herbs and spices. Lots of garlic powder and hot pepper flakes -natural preservatives that also kill some bacteria in food.   


 2 containers boullion cubes. 25+ lbs flour, cornmeal, dried mixed beans, and rice. A month's meals worth of dried or canned veggies. Canned or powdered milk. Canned meats. Whole wheat pasta. 5 lb bag of baking powder from Sam's, and baking soda. Cream of tartar.

&amp;#x200B;

 Eggs, which will keep a month in the fridge. Will keep much longer if you rub their shells with lard and bury them under a layer of salt in your pantry. Old pioneer ""no refrigerator"" trick. Get a couple gallons of food grade vinegar - apple cider and white both. Not only is it a good preservative, it's a badass cleaning and laundry cleaning product.  


If you have fresh veggies about to go bad, STOP WASTING THEM. Every single veg can either be cut thin and go into the oven on a tray with some salt, to dehydrate, or go into a jar and have boiling salted vinegar poured over them, then put in the fridge as refrigerator pickles.  


Get some borax and washing soda, and bulk bars of dial soap. Not only is it cheaper to stock up on than detergent, it disinfects better and you can make 5 gallons of detergent from 1 bar of soap, 1 cup of soda, 1 cup of borax. 17 cents a gallon cost to you.  


Step 5 - learn to cook pioneer one pot meals. [Allrecipies.com](https://Allrecipies.com) has plenty of recipes. You can DM me for my crock pot recipes. Don't go buy a pressure cooker or instapot if you don't already have one. You'd be better off to get a cheap crock pot and a food dehydrator. Although you can dehydrate foods and make jerky in a 200F oven easily.   


Don't be intimidated by learning to cook. Homemade gravy is fat, flour, water or chicken broth or milk, some meat crumbles and black pepper, and a spoonful of cornstarch if you're in a hurry; a bit of stirring and bam, gravy. Even lumpy beginner-made gravy tastes goooood.  


Learn to make 5 ingredient bread. If you DM me I will set up a video call on discord with you and walk you through it, if that's what it takes :)  


Soak beans and rice overnight and give the water to your houseplants or garden, before cooking. The grains will cook faster and more tender, and the beans will be de-gassed. Rinse before cooking, then fill with an inch more water than rice or beans and simmer on the stove or crock pit  til tender. Ham, onions, canned crushed tomatoes, some canned lil smokies sausage... mmmmm. One pot to clean, heckin good healthy filling food.   


You can get so many of these ""staples"" for SO MUCH cheaper than pre-packaged, pre-processed foods.   


Now, about toilet paper. Don't bother. Go to Lowe's or Home Depot, and get a 5 gallon lidded bucket for each bathroom. Get bleach, ammonia, or peroxide. Buy squares of cloth. Could be washrags, ""shop towels"" or ""dust cloths"" - you want a woven cotton thing happening here. No plushy texture synthetics. You can also just cut up old t-shirts. Or if the hoarders have hit, go to a craft store and get cotton t-shirt fabric. Make a ""diaper pail"" of a bucket filled 1/2 way with bleachwater, ammonia water, or peroxide water. DO NOT MIX ANY OF THESE CHEMICALS, PICK ONE.   


Get a spray bottle and put water, 1 drop of dish soap, 1 spoon of witch hazel. When you go bathroom, spray off your undercarriage then wipe with a damp cloth. Cloth goes in the lidded bucket. Once a week, dump the bucket into the washer with a 1/2 cup of bleach and run it on heavy duty. You never see, smell, or touch anything icky. I grew up this way and we went back to in in 2020 on New Year's to help #teamtrees. Once you get past the mental block of it, you may never go back.  


I grew up in a literal pioneer log cabin, gardening, raising egg and meat birds, milking dairy goats. I still live partly that way. We went shopping once a month and barely bought anything. If you want to know anything about prepping as a low key, chill, non-panicky set of small lifestyle changes you can slowly make one at a time, AMA in comments or DM me.   


You can and will get through this.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/flnnwp/under_50_nonperishable_pantry_shopping_list/

276,1584680160,swiftlikeninjas,Anxiety taking over :(,"
Hello,
I felt the need to post here because my anxiety has been taking over the past few days.

First,  a little about myself...
I’m 33 years old, wife &amp; mother.
T2 diabetic with anxiety disorder &amp; OCD, smoker (just quit a dew days ago). A lot of my anxiety stems from medical issues, so this situation is obviously triggering for me.
I am out of shape and get out of breath easily. I have a feeling there is something more serious wrong with me but have been too scared to get it checked out.

My husband works in a Mine with hundreds of employees that has not (and likely will not) shut down. They are required to ride buses with 20+ people or carpool with no less than 4 people to get to work. They do not have adequate hand-washing stations. They are often confined in small spaces.
The Mine is telling people to stay home and use their sick days if they have symptoms, and that they can use next years sick/vacation days if needed.
The guys that work there already come to work sick, and I feel that this policy is basically ensuring that will continue, symptoms of Coronavirus or not.

I am so scared I’m going to catch it from him (he’s basically saying it’s only a matter of time before he gets it). Luckily, he’s rather healthy. But I am not.

I’m following the CDC guidelines of disinfecting common surfaces and hand-washing.. but I feel like that’s not enough. I don’t know what else to do. I can’t focus on anything or think of anything other than this. I’ve been talking with my therapist daily and it’s not helping much. I don’t know what to do anymore.

284,1584696136,WeNeedDeadSpace4,Looking for opinions on self-isolation,"Hi,

I'm not a regular poster on Reddit, so I apologise if this is in the wrong place. I have a very small social circle, and I am just looking to get some opinions on my situation in the current pandemic. 

I live in Scotland, specifically in a small village near Dundee. I have asthma, although haven't had an asthma attack for a while now. As you will all know, having asthma means I am classed as vulnerable, according to the UK government and NHS. I'm not overly worried about my own health, but I am worried for my kids and others around me.

I am the sole carer for my children, and my ex partner (the kids mum) is pregnant, so is also classed as high risk.  I work in food retail, so come into contact with a large quantity of people that could be carriers. I feel I need to plan for worst-case scenario - I catch it, and having respiratory problems already, I am unable to fight it off - so I have two options as far as I can see.

1) Self-isolate due to my underlying health conditions, and play it safe. Not my preferred option but I have the kids to think about.

2) Go to work, as I work in a small village so not as likely to be at risk as anyone in the city. Avoid bigger cities, keep practising good hygiene etc. 

I don't know anyone else self-isolating, and whilst I'm not looking to follow the herd, I am starting to feel a bit ridiculed by those around me when I'm only trying to plan sensibly for my kids. If anyone is isolating, can I ask why you are and how long for? Were you met with the same scepticism that I've had?

I'm an American living in Mumbai, and I'm not sure whether it's better to stay locked down here (I'm working from home), or try to get back to the US ASAP.

I know that the virus is MUCH worse in the US currently, but if it gets really bad in India (especially because my state, Maharashtra, has it worst), the healthcare system could be easily overwhelmed and it'd be much better to be back in the US at the height of a pandemic.

I thought I'd wait to see how bad it gets before deciding, but now India has announced a ban on all international flight arrivals starting Sunday. I'm assuming that means no international flight departures too? And I've tried asking the embassy, but they really don't have any recommendations or anything that I can find.

300,1584728188,Paul-Canada,"Friend not taking it seriously, may have to stop visits","So I've practising social distancing and isolation!

* No more shops!
* 2m away from strangers
* No public transit, ubers and taxis. Cycling only (even in sub 0°C)!
* Opening doors with a plastic bag
* Hand sanitizer x 100 in public
* Upon getting home, washing myself, clothes and any products I do buy outside

Basically, I've got my game plan!

The only other place I go is to my best friend, by cycling. Unfortunately he thinks I'm being absolutely nutty and have a mental issue. I tried pointing out the dire situation in Europe (esp. Italy), and China's success.

He's still using public transit, seems nonchalant about hand sanitizing, etc. We got into a massive argument about it several times, and now he's being less communicative about his practices. I told him the visits may have to end if he can't take it seriously. He talked to a friend in China, who told him what the gov requires them to do. Seems to have made him a little more aware, but still not up to my high standard.

It's going to be below freezing today and this weekend. I still plan on cycling, and then running if ice forms on the roads. He's lecturing me about riding in unsafe conditions, but I honestly don't know what else to do. I don't have a car so!

I just wish he'd take it seriously... \[/rant\]",/r/COVID19_support/comments/flzszf/friend_not_taking_it_seriously_may_have_to_stop/
301,1584729141,Taucher1979,Tooth extraction cancelled. Getting anxious now.,"In October 2019 during a routine dental check up my dentist said my lower left wisdom tooth had a crack under the gum line and would need to be removed. Finally on Tuesday this week I had my assessment appointment at the hospital - I was told the tooth has a big hole and an infection around the roots. I hadn’t had any pain so was surprised.

Anyway they booked me in for extraction on Monday (23td March) but today I got a text today saying clinical activity next week is cancelled., and they will reschedule my extraction. No more explanation, no idea when they might reschedule for.

What do I do, just wait around for covid 19 with a raging tooth infection? I feel that my immune system is fighting the infection and am terrified even more of contracting coronavirus. My city has only had a handful of Covid cases so I was ok with going to the dental hospital on Monday but I am now worried that they might reschedule (if the DO reschedule) for weeks time when the situation might be worse.

I am incredibly anxious about this.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fm037b/tooth_extraction_cancelled_getting_anxious_now/
302,1584729277,tootsdafroots,Separated from my husband by an ocean and the stress is taking a toll on my health,"I'm in the US and my husband is in the UK. We've been apart for nearly two and a half months now while I've been waiting for my visa to process. It should be coming back within the next two weeks but as the situation is constantly evolving, I don't know what that's going to mean if I'll be able to travel if my date will be postponed... etc.

I'm deliberating what steps to take, what options we have, and how long those options will be available to us. Currently, my husband can still come to the US despite the ban as he falls under the exemption of being a spouse of a citizen. He would be able to enter the country with a return flight booked at maximum 90 days out which is what his visitor allowances are. This is an action that we could take right now... and I don't really know how long that option will be available to us.

Up until this point he wasn't really as concerned about this whole thing as I have been, but I finally convinced him to, at the very least, leave our flat in London and go stay with his parents. He finally agreed but it was like pulling teeth. I think he's finally starting to get the severity of this. 

He doesn't want to take 'drastic measures' because I think he's still in a little bit of denial about the whole thing. I think a lot of people are waiting and seeing when catastrophe will happen, but don't realize that it already is. We're so used to dramatizations of apocalyptic scenarios like The Walking Dead and other cinematic depictions but the truth is that real life will never feel quite like that, so it's hard to understand when it's appropriate do something 'drastic'.

On top of the worry of the illness its self, how long this will go on for, concern for my parents and family, I'm living every day wondering if I will get to see my husband in two weeks or 18 months. It's agonizing. It's taking a toll on my emotional health and subsequent physical health. I can't sleep, I can't eat, no matter how hard I try to focus on something else or transform my feelings into understanding that we'll be ok and to just surrender... I can't let go of it. It's just too big of an unknown. I feel like this is a really, really important time to not be separate from your spouse if you have one. We only just got married in September. 

I already feel myself getting sick at this point and I don't know if it's a cold, COVID 19, or just my immune system deteriorating over the massive stress. Because of this I'm worried that if I do get sick (if I'm not already) it could be really bad for me even though I'm young - 24. 

Again, I'm doing every single thing that I can to reduce my stress. I'm exercising, doing yoga, practicing deep breathing and even just started trying EFT. I've spoken to my therapist on the phone. Taking long hot baths. Calling friends. Watching movies. Working on projects that I've been wanting to work on. I've tried to figure out a mentally healthy news exposure routine - like not reading the news in bed and trying to preserve that as a safe space. Literally. Everything. But there's only so much that I can do. The only thing that gets me to sleep now is a decent sized dose of melatonin but I still wake up throughout the night and am experiencing vivid nightmares. I wake up feeling exhausted every morning and I don't want to get out of bed. 

While the whole situation is stressful, don't get me wrong, I just feel like having my husband by my side would eliminate a massive component of the stress that I'm experiencing. I always sleep better with him, just having the comfort and the physical contact of your partner is everything. 

As of right now I'm going to do my best to make it back to the UK when my visa comes, in 2 weeks we'll have to make a decision on what to do... but that's a long time. I almost just want him to take the opportunity that he has to come to the US... but he's reluctant. I just don't think that this is the time to be wagering our bets on everything working out in our favor. The risk we're facing is being separated for over a year. While that may not happen, it's not out of the possibility... and that isn't a bet that I want to take.

What do we do right now? I feel so incredibly lost... like I'm waking up from a nightmare into a nightmare every single day at this point.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fm04ja/separated_from_my_husband_by_an_ocean_and_the/
303,1584729851,seriousjake12,Would it be wrong of me to tell my girlfriend she can't come over if she goes out to get a haircut at a salon today?,"My girlfriend is supposed to come over and stay the night tonight. I live at home currently with my parents and younger brother. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we have been isolating at home except for going out for groceries every so often. We've been taking this very seriously as both myself and my father are immunocompromised and my mother has bad asthma. 

This morning I asked my girlfriend what time she was heading over and she said she would after her hair appointment at the salon today. This was the first I'd heard of the appointment. I asked her about it and told her my parents were concerned because she'd be in very close proximity with someone who is presumably seeing other clients right now. She told me that her mother got her haircut their yesterday and that it's only the owner working and she has had very few appointments recently due to all of this. 

I'm very torn because I really want to see her and I know she wants to see me but my parents and I are a bit concerned given the current times. I also would feel like a jerk if I told her she couldn't get her haircut if she wants to come over. My dad doesn't seem to care but that's just how he is and my mom is pretty paranoid about it right now. So WIBTA if I decide to tell her she can't come over if she goes out to get her hair cut?

Sometimes I feel like it's no big deal, and I'll be okay. But that's just because I'm forcing myself to stop thinking about the virus to try and get a moment's peace.

There was one confirmed case in my state last week. As of today, there are 96. It feels like everything around me is spinning out of control and I'm in a horror movie. Global epidemics are my biggest fear and I feel so trapped and hopeless.

I have a very very hard time thinking of what's going to happen if I get sick. I'll either have to lose my job from staying home, or go and get tested, and be a damn confirmed case and have them talk about me like I'm some kind of animal. ""Receiving care at this time"", things like that. The idea of being added to the numbers alone makes me stop in absolute fear. I cant handle that. I cant be in isolation, I cant be taken and held down for 2 plus weeks with doctors surrounding me at all times. 

If I get sick, I *WILL* kill myself. I cannot see any feasible way that I'll  be able to continue living as if nothing happened.

I got pulled to the side by one of my coworkers after I'd made some remarks about my fear of being a number, in which he told me that I would have to be tested, because I'd either lose my job or possibly get our immunocompromised coworker critically ill. And i started crying like a stupid little bitch. I didnt want to cry but I've always been sensitive and so it really hurt to know that I had no way around it. 

Idk what to do anymore. I'm honestly considering killing myself at this point. I feel so dragged down and hopeless and I dont know what I'm supposed to do. I cant work from home. My job (grocery store, deli counter) wont close. I'm at a loss, it just feels like everything is shattering around me.

To explain in more detail, my dad owns a restaurant in Germany, and I help him run it, and if hes on vacation visiting his Girlfriend in Canada like he is right now, I also do a bunch of management stuff. We also deliver beverage crates to several places, like the local butchers shop and a care home for disabled people.

Now to the fun part: On sunday a friend of mine stayed over night and I drove her to work the next day, later that day she told me she had fever and the next day she told me she was quarantined for 14 days since her mother also showed some of the symptons. So I thought I am going to do the sensible thing and quarantine myself for 14 days aswell. I phoned my dad and explained to him the situation and thought he got the message: Im potentially infected, and thus wont make any deliveries for the next 14 days. But today he sent me a message if I already did the deliveries, and after I didnt reply to such a stupid question he said that hes sad I dont talk more with him about the business and if I have a problem with him, and to be honest, I kinda do after stuff like this situation. I told him that I was quite mad about him seemingly ignoring my concerns for my own and other peoples health and safety, to which he replied, freely translated from german:

"" You got any symptons? Life goes on, just wear some gloves and dont talk to people (I have to ask people in the care center what exactly they need, any idea how to do that without talking to them?). Just do your job. And if you think that you are terminally ill then get some help, They need their drinks since they arent closed. I think you are overreacting and abusing the situation.""

 I am waiting on biopsy results right now of probable cancer, and I have NO IDEA how the hell I am going to have to deal with this right now.  

My Doc saw me yesterday for a follow up from an issue that's been going on since January (she's only seeing patients with issues, no checkups or annuals), and what was supposed to be a routine thing she suddenly rushed out of the room and came back saying "" I'm taking a biopsy now, and I will personally get it through the lab.  We aren't supposed to be overrunning the lab but we need to take this today"".  

She was great and explained everything, but essentially best case scenario this mass is benign and I still have to have it removed, which requires surgery under general anesthesia.  Worst case, it is malignant and I have to have a more complicated surgery plus whatever else they deem needed to start me healing (radiation or chemo).  

But, in light of all this insanity, what does that actually look like?!?!  Do I have to wait however long, knowing this is a thing, and risking spread?

For the most part, just working on the list has been helping me.

Since I am hoping this list will help others I am trying to make it sort of a community project. The community is the world I guess, haha. Anyways, I am taking suggestions of things to add.

The list is simply a Google doc that I have been working on for a couple of days. I don't gain anything from making it or from other people checking it out. It's just something I am hoping will help some people.

There are things like books, movies, shows, music playlists, podcasts, crafts, tips and tricks, etc.

I am thinking of adding things like a list of places to learn new things online.

The Google doc can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4gyJdoLdL18z0tmeEurmy4iXqa0c4B2JN4Jqb49YAg/edit?usp=sharing) for anyone interested in giving me ideas or just getting ideas from it.

I'm in university and I live in a very small apartment without a view or a balcony, in an 80-party house. In case of a curfew I might not even be able to take the trash out. And there is speculation about a curfew being implemented on Monday here in Germany.I am suffering from multiple mental conditions and I don't think spending 2+ weeks on less than 20sqm would be something I would survive unharmed.

Now I have two options to stay for longer time - I could move to my boyfriend (who lives in a house with his mom, who is older so a bit riskier) or I could go to my family, where my grandpa also lives (who is high risk).I'm quite torn about what I should do. Obviously there are downsides to either one. In either case, my bf or my mom would get me with a car.

Pro for staying with bf: Is closer, only one I saw since isolation began (so we'd have infected each other by now), I'd have someone to cuddle, I really don't not want to see him for so longCons: We are already a bit in a though spot rn and this would either make or break us, I can't keep a structure staying with him, I'd have no privacy

Pros for staying with family: I already miss them, I'd have privacy and be able to keep a structure better there, there's a dog, the house is bigger so more space to move aroundCons: My grandpa is extremely high risk (and I currently have a cold - no fever, cough isn't dry), but could be asymptomatic and bring the illness upon people I haven't yet and potentially kill my family (that's my anxiety speaking but yknow), I wouldn't see any peers, esp not my boyfriend, it's way farther away.

I just got over a cold about 2 weeks ago (complete with runny nose and a lingering phlegmy cough) and my lungs still aren't 100%.  I mentioned my anxiety to my husband and he recommended exercise. I followed along with a youtube deep breathing exercise video before bed. 

Today, the weather was really terrible, so this afternoon I went on Amazon Prime to find some exercise videos. First we watched one that we pretty cheesy (Kid Exercise Workout with Paul Eugene), but it was aimed at kids and didn't require any equipment. I actually worked up a bit of a sweat (sadly, I'm pretty out of shape). 

Next, we turned on **Cosmic Kids Yoga Adventure**. It was great- my daughter and I both liked the story (slightly cheesy, but after the first video our standards weren't very high). Afterwards, I felt a lot better.

Have read a couple of books before I start teaching 100% online next week. But today, I wanted to get a few more staples before as mandatory quarantine gets put in place. Plus, I'm an econ teacher. I'm curious to see the shortages and just how bad they are. 

Soups all gone. A little bread. No meat. No eggs. Soap, toilet paper, paper towels, all gone. Water gone, I expected that given I live in Florida, and that's the first thing to go. Scenes from a Soviet grocery store taking place at a Winter Park Publix. What bothered me most was the mothers with younger children in tow. Their expressions were nothing but masks of fear. The thought in their head, written on their faces, ""How am I going to feed my kids?"" And not from lack of money, but from lack of goods. 

I drove home and unloaded my stuff, and as I put it away, I gave genuine thought to buying a firearm. Not because I'm afraid if my neighbors or my neighborhood. Just more of an unknown fear. To be prepared. 

Finally, a friend texted if any of us had a chance to unwind this week, after all, it is Spring Break. Took me two hours to respond, but when I did:

""No, I have not relaxed. I've done whatever I can to prep and escape and on my end, I'm fine. What I really do not want to face is the one question that will be on the lips of every senior two months from graduation: what's going on? I'm not just dreading it as a teacher, but also as an economics teacher. There is no white lie I can tell them, like I can my freshmen. And even with the freshmen, they're not stupid, they know something is up...What's worse for my seniors, I've given them the necessary tools to explain how much trouble we're in, especially AP. Know what my lesson plan is for next week, according to the curriculum? Long term consequences of fiscal and monetary policy, including what happens when it fails. There's a graph that accompanies it called the Phillips Curve, with which I will show them the upcoming economic apocalypse. Next week, my job is to show 18 year olds that a lot of their future over the next decade just went poof. There's a large part of me that still believes knowledge is the most important thing in terms of fighting against problems like Corona and what is the impending recession/depression.

I’m far better prepared to weather this storm than most, and yet I feel incredibly guilty to have brought a child into the hellscape that 2020 is becoming.

It’s irrational, we could have never known what was coming, but I had an ethical crisis when we got pregnant in the first place. Does the world really need more people? What opportunities will be available to her? Will she survive the pandemic? If so will it be followed by a life that seems to be becoming more dystopian every year?

She’s only three weeks old, and I’m terrified for her safety to the point where I feel like it is limiting my ability to bond with her.
I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression in the past, with great success. I’m highly distrustful of anti depressants, but none of the non pharmacological tools I learned from my prior experience seem to be applicable.

I can’t get out and force myself to socialize. My hobby is photography, specifically astrophotography. I don’t feel safe leaving my wife &amp; child at home to drive up into the mountains because what if something happens? She gets a fever? My depression deepens in further isolation?

I’ve turned to a professional before, and she’s great, but no one is taking this seriously in my area and I fear she would write me off as losing touch with reality. Irrational about the pandemic is the one thing I don’t feel. I’m surrounded by high risk individuals.
I thought going back to work from paternity leave would help, getting out of the house and being more productive. It hasn’t. I work with the elderly and I’m nearly as concerned for them as my family. I live in simultaneous fear that I’ll take the virus to work, or bring it home with me. Nowhere feels safe anymore.

My wife is great. I’m going to talk to her tonight, but I fear she won’t relate to a lot of my feelings.

I'm a hypochondriac and have what I hope are allergies: a cough, post nasal drip, sneezing occasionally, and I've also been having really bad headaches, chest pains, and diarrhea, which I think at this point is from stress and anxiety. But I've still been taking my temperature 20 times a day, because I can't not think about catching coronavirus.

I was even on an upswing over the last couple days, I felt good enough to go out to the dispensary today to get some edibles as it's one of the only things that calms me down (I'm in California). The only reason I was okay going was because they had curbside pickup and had sent emails outlining good distancing procedures they were using. They didn't follow anything on their email. I rolled my window down to talk to the delivery girl, and she just came right up to my window (the email said they'd stay 6 feet back), probably within 2-3 feet of me, and handed me a bag. I came home and washed my hands thoroughly and then took a shower and put on clean clothes. Now I can't stop worrying that she may have been asymptomatic and infected me.

This is all just too much, and I don't know how to cope with all this anxiety and stress. And what if I do get sick, the hospitals here in California are going to be way overrun with in a week.

I know this is how I generally respond in crises (when I was sick 2 years back everything seemed more clear to me as well), but it also gives me a weird sense of not falling out of line with the world like usual and many more ways of suddenly being able to do things online and being 'on par' with 'the rest'. Also I'm a bit overwhelmed with my feeling of love toward all the people volunteering (like the total strangers who did my groceries today or the dance instructor giving live online lessons); where I usually feel pretty lonely and   out of touch and having a hard time asking for help or companionship.

I feel like I should feel guilty about feeling those positive things, because people are dying and people in other countries are losing their jobs and won't get social benefits (apart from still not being in a lock down and having a pretty low number of ICUbeds per capita my government seems to have it pretty well in order to keep people on extra social benefits)

Are there people who can relate? Am I crazy for feeling overwhelmed by both the stress and crazyness of this situation, fear of getting sick or losing loved ones and loneliness, as well as a sudden feeling of rest, piece, and connection that I usually don't have?

39,1584799703,KnifelikeVow,Is anyone else struggling with people who just will not stay 6 feet away...,"Everytime I go outside, usually to walk my dog, I see other people out on the street. It seems like very few people bother trying to keep any distance at all. Instead, people march up the middle of the sidewalk and don’t give any indication they’re going to move, so I have to go way around them just to get 6 feet between us.

That would be manageable if that was all it was, but some other people will walk right up to me, or right next to me, without me realizing they’re coming (like from behind). And everytime it happens I end up panicking and being more afraid to go out. 

To be clear, it is definitely people who are either not aware of safe distance requirements or who don’t give a fuck who are making it difficult, so I’m not referring to accidentally getting close to someone. 

I know the odds are low that any one person in a brief encounter is going to get me sick, but I’m an asthmatic who is still coughing from a cold I had last month, so I’ve got a higher risk of being a more serious COVID-19 case if I catch it. And it’s really getting to me how much of a pain in the ass it is to keep my distance from other people who just don’t care.

We got needed supplies weeks ago, he works from home, we sanitize everything that we bring inside, we wash all clothes and take showers after coming inside, we barely leave the apartment in the first place, etc. We're doing everything we're supposed to be doing right now. 

Problem is he fully believes that society will collapse within a year. He keeps his hatchet with him by the bed at night (in a protective sheath but still...) because he fears looters will break into our apartment. Trying to help him calm down has utterly failed because his fears have proven to be correct over and over again as this disease has progressed. I can't get him to stop checking the news because it makes his anxiety worse because he feels he's not informed enough to prepare for things. Every bit of good news I tell him is countered with bad news. It doesn't help that both his parents would absolutely die of COVID should they get it. His dad has had both histoplasmosis and sarcoids. He can barely breath as it is. His mom is diabetic, previously had cancer, and overweight.

*While rubbing alcohol naturally kills bacteria and viruses, Dr. Andrew Alexis, MD, chair of Mount Sinai West's department of dermatology, says he does not recommend using it to disinfect your home. “While commonly used to disinfect smaller objects such as stethoscopes, rubber stoppers of medication vials, and thermometers, alcohol solutions are extremely evaporative and therefore not an effective means of decontaminating household surfaces,” he explains.*

63,1584831494,Marz0n,Going home to family or living alone.,"I’m a college student living in an apartment in NYC. My roommates have now all gone home to their families, for an indefinite amount of time. Leaving me entirely alone...

Living alone for potentially weeks/months seems extremely lonely, especially considering I will be social distancing and won’t be seeing friends at all. I will be online with friends on voice chats, so I guess that would help a bit if I do stay. 

Because of this was also looking to go home via bus to my family. Normally I’d be okay waiting, but I’m worried that nyc might go under full quarantine and I would be stuck here. 

From what I’m reading, traveling is exactly what I shouldn’t be doing. So I’m questioning my decision and was looking for some advice. Would my reasons for leaving justify going home?",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fmow5b/going_home_to_family_or_living_alone/
64,1584831596,RedXon,Thanks for appreciating us,"I just need to get this out.

I work as a security guard in many different types of security. And therefore, yes, I'm still out there almost every day, I'm still working and I'm doing it for the benefit of hopefully everyone. Now, I'm not saying that I'm as important as a person in the medical field or someone who is keeping the food distribution working but our jobs become more important and meanwhile more exhausting (at least mentally) every day. And while yes, more people nowadays stop and thank me personally for my work etc. I still feel that we and the police are under appreciated these days.

I am in front of hospitals and enforce the no visitors rule and send people with symptoms to a separate area. I stand in front of grocerie stores and pharmacies and ensure that not too many people enter. I am at the train stations and make sure that groups no bigger than 5 people are hanging out and sending them away etc. And I'm not doing that because I have fun to be the ""no fun police"" or because I like to make peoples lifes more difficult but because it is important right now and because people are too stupid to follow these rules by themselves. And yes, most days I'd rather stay at home the whole day and watch TV or play games and isolate myself from the risks but I don't because someone has to do that job and hopefully it helps us to return to normality just a little bit faster.

And yes, these days it hurts especially when someone just curses at me or doesn't follow the rules just because they are stupid and he wants to party or whatever. Because normally he wouldn't cause big harm, maybe of me a little bit and some other people there but now that ahole is hurting everyone be being a selfish idiot. So please everyone, next time you see a security guard doing public work to keep everyone just a little bit safer, just try to be thankful. Not only now but also when this thing is over. I'm not doing it because I like being the party popper that hates fun, I'm doing it so that everyone is a little safer.

68,1584834041,MrStallionVsDrReason,My Work is Ignoring Regulations in Violation to State and Federal Mandate. What can I do? This is not political. Just wondering if others are dealing with similar issues to talk about it.,"My work is not implementing any protocols to protect workers or customers. We are a non-essential customer facing business in Furniture Retail. We have higher than normal foot traffic with over 6k people per weekend through our doors. At this time our state is close to implementing a hotline to report business who are giving no care to follow any regulation. 

Our owner has even stated that staying open is our civic duty as the regulations in place are in direct violation of our 1st amendment rights to congregate. He is making this whole thing political and ignoring the consequences of his actions. Easy for him to say while he sits in his office upstairs and doesn’t have to work with any people directly. But expects his workers to be present or else they are support the Tyranny of government trying to control our lives. It seems like a lunatic in action. 

We are non-essential and should be closed for business for a period of time until it is safe to truly operate within regulations.  

Just curious if anyone else is living this same type of issue in their lives also.

72,1584835539,aristhought,"Individualism, Collectivism, Why Some Cultures Are Coping with COVID-19 Better Than Others, and How We Can Learn and Survive the Pandemic","Had some time on my hands so I wrote this this morning. My psychology degree has a purpose! 


The middle of a pandemic is possibly not the best time to pull out cultural psychology texts, but an understanding of cultural values towards agency and adaptation may shed light on how people are coping (or not coping) with the current coronavirus situation, and how people can make things easier on themselves. 

It was in high school that I first learned about individualism versus collectivism, yet it is still very relevant, and continues to be a topic of great significance even in university and beyond. Thousands of psychological and sociological studies have been done on individualism vs collectivism. It is arguably one of the best evidenced and fundamental theories of cultural psychology.

To put it in quick terms: America is the most individualist country in the world. China and Japan are close cousins for being some of the most collectivist. 

Individualist countries (and citizens) value individuality, personal agency and choice, and the power to shape your own life and reality. 

Collectivist countries on the other hand value the collective, community wellbeing, even with significant self sacrifice, and place much less value on personal agency, and much more on adaptation to others and to reality. 

Neither type of culture is inherently better than the other. But one type is uniquely more suited to adapting to a worldwide pandemic, and that’s collectivism. 

Politics aside, learning values from cultures different from our own, and understanding that some of our turmoil and pain from lack of agency and freedom during this time (for a distinctively altruistic purpose) is not permanent nor necessarily untouchable, can help us all adapt quicker, and thereby get back to a normal life faster, with a lot less loss of life and less possibility of completely collapsing healthcare systems.

Individualist cultures have the hardest time with personal freedom and choice taken away from them. They would always rather have the freedom to make their own choices, and even see life as ridden with more opportunities to make choices than more collectivist cultures. Regardless of whether or not the consequences are better or worse, individualists much rather have the agency to choose themselves - even if it leads to bad consequences. 

This not only hints at why America is so divided on political issues like Medicare For All (one of the prevailing arguments against it is “but I want to be able to choose what kind of healthcare I get”), but why even small curves of freedom (aka, shutting down schools and extracurriculars), feel much more painful and impossible to individualist cultures than collective ones. Americans may find it not too hard to be ordered to stay indoors for a week, but by week 2 or 3, they’re much more likely to grow antsy and say “fuck it,” effectively breaking quarantine.

Collective ones are much more comfortable with some choices and freedoms being taken away as long as it’s for the collective good. Wuhan was able to be completely shut down not only because of the power of the government there but also because people understood and valued the greater group wellbeing despite personal liberties being more or less removed completely. 

Whilst that’s an extreme case, and possibly mocked by Americans for being “like mindless sheep,” a little shifting of mindset to prioritizing collective health over individual choice may help people adapt, and also save lives. 

The extreme fundamental difference between individualist views on agency and choice versus collectivist views on them underlies the continued bemusement of Americans at concepts like arranged marriages (even though, interestingly enough, they statistically succeed more than chosen marriages), Asian parents choosing career paths for their children, and more. 

But in times of crisis we all have a little something to learn from each other. And if you’re willing to be more selfless than usual, for a much longer period of time than usual, for your local healthcare, for your local elderly and immunocompromised population, I promise we will all collectively be better off. 

Another fascinating dimension of difference between individualist cultures and collectivist ones are their attitudes towards reality: or rather, whether their instinct is to change reality to mould to what they want, or to adapt their own attitudes and self to reality. 

The difference is startling. Studies have shown again and again that individualist cultures are far more ready to exert influence on their surroundings to change them to what they want them to be - and this includes other people (aka arguing with others, standing up, taking leadership roles). 

Alternately, collectivist cultures across the board are far more able and willing to adapt to surroundings and others to keep the peace - after all, when you value the collective peace and wellbeing over your own individual one, it is far easier to be willing to change your own mindset and behaviours rather than to change others. 

This dimension of difference also underlines why individualist countries might have a collectively harder time following social distancing and quarantine rules, especially for an extended period of time. It simply isn’t a natural instinct for them to adapt rather than to try and be proactive and act upon their newfound reality. 

Unfortunately, the virus does not care. For once we’re faced with something we can’t change or control, and we need to adapt or face the consequences. And whilst consequences can be as mild as you just needing to spend more time alone for a while, they can be as severe as healthcare system collapse and personal illness and death.

I’m already anticipating the gut reaction backlash against writing this in that Americans especially might jump on my back for trying to indoctrinate “communist values” or whatever, or somehow insinuating that we all need to be like mindless robots now. But that isn’t the case, and your gut reaction backlash really underscores how unconscious and deeply entrenched these cultural differences around the world are. 

I’m not saying one type of culture is better than the other, nor am I saying Americans should now be collectivist (because that is never happening regardless). 

Your liberties and long held values are facing pressure and stress, and that’s understandable. You don’t need to turn into a fierce leftist to learn from other cultures in times of unprecedented crisis, especially because adaptation and valuing the collective, greater good in community health is going to help you and your loved ones too. It is painful to have deeply entrenched ways of life and values be upturned. But these are unprecedented times and there is no time to experiment - it is time to adapt and survive, or refuse to adapt and bear the consequences - and the consequences won’t just affect you. It will affect your community. 

A few months or a year may feel like a lifetime in times of crisis. But in reality, it is a very short period of time in the grand scheme, and a time for resilience, adaptation, and altruism. When your character is being tested for the greater good, sometimes it hurts for a while. But I promise in hindsight that if we do it right, we’ll look back on this time with pride and not with regret and sadness.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fmq2bd/individualism_collectivism_why_some_cultures_are/

This is the FIRST worldwide pandemic occurring during mass social media. 

Sars was back in 2003, before Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit even existed. H1N1 was even in the baby years of those sites.

There is so much information, misinformation, fear mongering, lies, etc. being constantly shoved into our faces that it's turned into one big overwhelming mess. 

Every news site wants to be at the forefront, to the point they will print misinformation stretching to outright lies. Most will get more and more outrageous to compete with one another for that viewcount. 

Just remember that Doctors and Scientists around the world are working around the clock to not only find a vaccine, but better ways to manage symptoms. The best way you can help is by maintaining social distancing to give them that needed time.

88,1584849884,Sbeast,Coronavirus Advice,"**Introduction**

This post is includes general advice to better understand the coronavirus, and a list of suggestions to stay safe, calm, and to help ride out this storm.

Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that are typically mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), though rarer forms can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019, referred to as COVID-19, originated in Wuhan in Hubei, China, and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

At the time of writing this post there are 155,800 cases, 5,800 deaths, and 74,000 recoveries. The numbers are all expected to continue to increase in the upcoming weeks and months, and it is likely they will increase an an exponential rate until it reaches a peak, and then will continue to decline until the pandemic is over.

We should be taking this very seriously, however, we should not cause unnecessary panic or stress to ourselves or others if it can be avoided. Preparation and wisdom is the key mindset to adopt.

&amp;#x200B;

**Practical Advice**

* Wash hands - using soap and hot water to wash hands for around 20 seconds.
* Social distancing - reduce close contact between people for the time being. Read more [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-what-does-social-distancing-mean/607927/).
* Sneeze into elbow.
* Avoid touching face as much as possible.
* If you feel unwell, especially with a high temperature, persistent cough, you should either stay home, or consider visiting your doctor. **If in doubt, check** **local** **advice**.
* Do’s and Don’ts of hand washing - [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dos-and-donts-of-handwashing-11583952006](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dos-and-donts-of-handwashing-11583952006)
* Not everyone you know is going to be affected or die, but you should be extra kind to others during this time regardless of what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

**Positive mindset**

It is important to maintain an optimistic yet positive mindset during this time to reduce unnecessary worry, anxiety and panic. Here are a few mindsets to consider during this time:

* We are all in this together.
* Many have recovered already, and many will not be affected by it.
* All bad things, including pandemics have the opportunity to make us love each other, ourselves and life more.
* Petty arguments and worries become less relevant and important during times of crises.
* If you cannot be loving and helpful in a crisis, then when can you.
* Those who survive may develop an increased appreciation for life.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vaccines**

Scientists are working on vaccines, which hopefully will be available soon:

**Stress**

Stress can inhibit our bodies' ability to fight off infections. Some stress is healthy, but too little and we may not take the right actions, and too much makes us more vulnerable.

From the following [article](https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html) on stress and the immune system:

&gt;*When we’re stressed, the immune system’s ability to fight off antigens is reduced. That is why we are more susceptible to infections.*  
*The stress hormone corticosteroid can suppress the effectiveness of the immune system (e.g. lowers the number of lymphocytes).*  
*Stress can also have an indirect effect on the immune system as a person may use unhealthy behavioural coping strategies to reduce their stress, such as drinking and smoking.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Activities**

These activities are more for those who have been advised to stay at home for some time.

* Read books
* Listen to Podcasts
* Listen to Music (especially relaxing music)
* Watch some films
* Play some games
* Writing - books, articles, poetry, blog posts.
* Comedy - films, videos, memes.
* Activism - do something constructive, such as online activism, or some form of volunteering if you can.
* Mindfulness
* Meditation
* Exercise

89,1584851053,iamthewallrus,I've been mildly sick for the past several days and I'm terrified that I have the virus,"This has been my symptoms since Tuesday:

Tuesday, March 17th: sneezing and allergy-like symptoms such as clear nasal mucus. No fever. Diarrhea from anxiety. Periodic shortness of breath from anxiety.

Wednesday, March 18th: similar allergy symptoms, development of phlegm. Sore throat. Periodic shortness of breath from anxiety. No fever.

Thursday, March 19th: phlegm and sore throat. Occasional cough with phlegm. No fever. Periodic shortness of breath from anxiety. 

Friday, March 20th: Phlegm and sore tonsils, not so much a sore throat anymore. Occasional cough with phlegm. Occasional shortness of breath due to anxiety, responds well to inhaler. Temperature 99.1.

Saturday, March 21st: reduced phlegm, reduced sore tonsils, cough seems to be going away, but temperature rising to 99.5. Hocked a loogie and there was a small stripe of blood in it that concerned me. Hocked a 2nd loogie, was there again. Hocked a 3rd and 4th and no blood. Seemingly normal energy level, but anxiety over possible infection drove me to bed, and once again had anxiety diarrhea. 

Am I going crazy or could I be infected? I'm 28 which I know is an age of lower risk of death but the risk is still there and it terrifies me. I've been taking vitamins and supplements like D3 and turmeric for the past several days, as well as elderberry syrup. I'm honestly quite scared, more so because I don't want to pass it to my husband who usually gets a bit more sick than I do. I know no one would give me a test at this point which sucks.

I live in a (very) small studio in DC and am strictly self-quarantining but desperate to be with them. My dad and I want to get my mom out of the house (both have no underlying conditions that we are aware of, but they are in their 60s). I'm trying to accept that I cannot change my dad's situation. One option would be to have my mom come to DC, which would be bringing her into a tiny apartment in the city for a long period of time. I'm happy to do it but would like to avoid that if possible. Another option would be for me to just stay with them while I'm teleworking, although I'm scared I'd get sick and become a burden. The third option is for me to find an AirBnB for the month of April to move either my mom and I to or my dad to. This would create a big financial burden, but if it's our only safe option, we can consider it. Ideally, I'd just go to their house and stay with them. They've been taking precautions for a while now (frequent hand-washing, social distancing, etc.). My mom is now sleeping in my old bedroom.

TL;DR: The title.

I woke up to this news of 793 people dying in Italy. I just can't imagine what the situation is soon going to be in my country, Bangladesh. Most residents here are illiterate, filled with superstition. Already 24 people are affected, 2 died. Nobody is abiding by the quarantine laws. Doctors have no PPE. Hospitals are returning diseased people who have the symptoms. The government is trying, somewhat, but even those people are dumbasses. They themselves are making huge, dense gatherings in the press briefings. Bangladesh is one of the most dense countries of the world and I'm sure, horrible things await for her.

So in this situation, my friends and I would like to do something to help this poor country. Like spreading awareness or helping this corona situation in any way possible. We're 18 each. Can you give us some suggestions? We're each skilled at different things, for example, I can make decent smartphone apps and websites.

96,1584860414,angolmois666,it's the uncertainty that gets to me the most,"Hi everyone. hope you're taking good care of yourselves.

I've noticed lately that, despite me being a massive hypochondriac, the main worry I have about this pandemic is that I don't know what will happen rather than me getting sick. I mean, it's something that a lot of people are going through right now.

For me though, I've noticed that it's been so hard to unwind with all of this going down. I have a hard time trying to keep my mind off of stressful situations, so usually my response is to try to tackle them head-on because I don't like to run away from my problems.

This time though, I feel like this has completely backfired. I'm absolutely consumed by all of this information. I don't know who or what to trust. I feel like I've been in a near-constant panic attack for the last week or so. I've been basically glued to the screen researching info about COVID-19. The further down the rabbit hole, the scarier and scarier it goes.

For a bit of context, I live in Washington state, so this has been on my mind for a bit. The nursing home where a bunch of people got infected was very close to where I grew up. But even then, I still had this ""it can't happen here"" level of denial about it all, which I'm really kicking myself for having. I'm one that follows a lot of global news, yet the complete shutdown of everything in such a short period of time utterly blindsided me.

I'm someone that really likes to carefully plan and schedule out most of my life. Now, I understand that sudden and foreseen schedule changes are a normal part of everyday life, and yet I still somewhat melt down whenever things change. So you can imagine that I'm basically almost completely unable to process ANY of this happening. Not only are classes online and a bunch of events that I was looking forward to postponed indefinitely, the fate of the jobs and housing of my friends and I is completely up in the air.

My brain has basically been on lockdown. I moved in back with my parents for an uncertain amount of time (may return here for the rest of the quarter/summer, not sure), and in that time I basically have spent most of my days researching stories and data about coronavirus. In all this research, it's so hard to tell what's bogus and what's not. Will we be on lockdown for 3 weeks or 18 months? Do we have medicine to help fight the coronavirus or does none of it work? Will the USA be another Italy or are the circumstances different enough? Will this be a relatively minor footnote within our history or will this be a mass generational trauma on par with WWII and the Great Depression?

In all of this, I'm trying to find optimism. Although I'm very upset that most of my life for the next few months (or even years) is up in the air, I think it snapped me out of a sense of complacency I had for a while that I took for granted. In all of this, we're really seeing the best come out of a lot of people. The problem is, I really haven't felt optimistic about any major political event in a while. My dad always told me ""hope for the best and expect the worst"" and usually the worst case scenario happens. 

I know that my problems ultimately aren't unique. This is really an unprecedented global tragedy in our modern era that's gonna shake off a lot of things we took for granted. In a way, I don't want to go back to ""normal"" after any of this; I'm hoping we'll take a lot of positive lessons away from this to plan for a better tomorrow. Ultimately, I'm paranoid though that we will take the exact OPPOSITE lessons than we should from all of this. Worse, I'm even more paranoid that the neglect from governments and industries will lead to a massive collapse of modern life as we know it, worse than 9/11, worse than the Recession, possibly even worse than the Spanish Flu if you factor in the economic aspects.

It could be possible that maybe none of this will ever happen. I have faith in humanity ultimately; I believe that most people have good intentions and act accordingly. But the problem is that its the uncertainty of this all that gets to me the most, on whether or not I or my loved ones have COVID, or how long these lockdowns will last, or if the society we'll wake up to once this is over will not be one worth saving. How does one be able to cope in all of this? I feel really alone and no one to really turn to right now. Thank you, Hope you are all taking care in these times. Apologies this got so long.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fmvr9l/its_the_uncertainty_that_gets_to_me_the_most/

Hi, based in Ireland, where C-19 is starting to go up in numbers like every where else.

I live with my ex and our son, she is extremely ill and needs care which is why I haven’t moved out since our break up. She is at high risk due to her medication and I’m at high risk due to regular smoking (Yes I know now is as good a time as possible to try quitting again)

We’ve self-isolated for a week since last Friday (13/03) and today I drove down to my parents as they’d done a late shop (whole separate topic around why on earth my senior parents were going shopping when we aren’t). Anyway, she had been massively against the idea, not trusting my parents’ adherence to social distancing and general behaviour (they’re the type to try Reiki and Acupuncture and so on rather than see a doctor). I promised her that my dad would leave the groceries outside, I’d wipe/spray them all down and the put them into our own shopping bags to eliminate any risk of virus from them or the shops they were in.

So far so good, I did that. But then I also stood outside talking to my parents for probably around 1.5 to 2 hours, keeping about 5 meters distance and (benefit of smoking), making sure the wind was not blowing from one of us to the other but rather sideways (if that makes sense).

I message her when I’m on the way back as I know she may be worried why I haven’t returned. I tell her what I did and she goes absolutely ballistic. I know she has a fear of enclosed spaces and the thought of having C-19 especially terrifies her utterly (this is just for context). I do understand her anger that I did more than just get the shopping, but I just can’t shake the thought that she is being entirely irrational. I can’t think of any way we could have transmitted anything (never mind a virus) between us while we were talking outside. She keeps talking about how I have no clue and there is no way I can guarantee there was no transfer and now that I’m back, has told me I need to enter my bedroom through the french doors leading outside and has locked the inside door. So I can enter my room but not the rest of the house. She’s also wondering whether it makes more sense for me to self isolate in here for 2 weeks or if it’s better for her to self isolate in her room for 2 weeks, and how both situations are totally shit and will be really hard on our son, who has on and off separation anxiety.

I’m really sorry for the long post and I really don’t know who to ask to help reassure her that there really wasn’t any risk.

117,1584892502,citybyte,Being too scared to escape NYC,"I live in Brooklyn, which has the most cases out of all the boroughs of NYC. It's scaring the shit out of me considering I had an extensive history of childhood respiratory problems and seasonal asthma, despite otherwise being a healthy 21 year old female. 

My family living in central Florida has been asking me to come back, but so many factors make me question if I should return.

For one, air travel. Is it even safe anymore? Despite being only $18 for a one way ticket, I'm seriously terrified of even going near an airport. It's terrifying even going outside... so many people aren't taking this seriously, talking in groups and COUGHING ON EACH OTHER right in the streets and causally continuing their conversation, or kids playing tag and soccer in the park, not to mention the increase in race-related hate crimes and hostility (I'm Chinese)... wtf y'all

I'm also scared that I'm possibly asymptomatic and might be bringing it back home, infecting my dad in his 50s or my 19 y/o immunocompromised brother. Learning that males have a nearly 2x higher death rate made me rethink if I should even be in the same house as them. 

My mom is a respiratory therapist working in Florida, also in her 50s. I'm not on good terms with her and cut her out of my life in my teens, but yet I'm still deathly worried knowing she'll likely catch the virus and will be working without proper safety gear. My 29 y/o sister is a doctor as well, primarily working in the ICU. Even if she's young, I'm hearing cases of young doctors her age falling seriously ill just from being around so many infected patients. It just feels like my entire immediate family is all at a higher risk and it's doesn't feel fair at all.

It feels like there isn't really a right choice for me to make. I've been debating for days on if I should just buy the damn ticket or not, and I really wish all this bullshit would just blow over.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fn1soy/being_too_scared_to_escape_nyc/

I live in Canada, Quebec, for reference. Both region and city in the province have 1 and 2 confirmed cases out of 7k (city) and 236k (region I'm currently staying in) people respectively. 
My parents recently contacted me to tell me that I should make it back to my home town while the world is on pause economically.

The only problem I'm facing, is that I have a mild sore throat for 6 days now and a small cough every couple of hours and I'm going to be at my dad's place. My dad does hypertension and is 56 so I figured he'd be at a greater risk if he gets the virus.

Now I'm very stressed out on the fact that I could involuntarily give him the virus if I do have it. I told him about it and it doesn't worry him too much, whilst the situation that I'm staying home alone with someone (my roommate) that cleans nearby hospitals is stressing him. Also, he said he feels lonely and would appreciate my company in those tough times. 

I don't know what to do. I actually want to join back my dad because this situation gives me anxiety. So I'm very indecisive if I should go ahead and do it, under the circonstances...",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fn37d5/moving_with_my_hypertensive_dad_tomorrow_and_not/

126,1584903630,Serpente-Azul,How to handle the virus when it hits (just fought out my battle and passing on my experience),"Ok, I was showing mild signs of a cold for about 4 days, first symptoms were super easy going.

I occasionally experienced mild disorientation and confusion, and a little difficulty breathing, but not anything to report.

When it hit me, a lot of those mild symptoms remained the same, and didn't escalate. So I retained a feeling that I wasn't ""really sick"".

And as I was chatting to a friend over messenger, I suddenly couldn't type or respond to say ""I'm fine"". I became confused, dizzy, disoriented, I waded through options in a confused haze, not wanting to call an ambulance because I didn't want to create a fuss. But I did a test online that was set up by the health services and it said ""contact this number immediately"". I had every symptom except a fever (I had severe chills, traumatic shortness of breath, and disorientation and was barely conscious).

I called the ambulance and realised I could barely speak more than a few words without losing my breath. My voice was distorted by how weak my breath was. The ambulance said they would take an hour and I was like ""nice, thank you"".

I sat and waited, and began having even more trouble with my breathing, to the point I woke up a friend of mine to watch me in case I passed out. I at this time could not breathe very well at all, and was scared that if I lost consciousness I might not be able to regulate my breathing (because breathing required a lot of effort, and if you can imagine that when you are passed out you breathe a lot more passively).

I sat still and tried to stay conscious, and began stopping responding to verbal stimuli. So was on the middle of the consciousness spectrum between needing to be prompted with pain to respond. The pain was in my chest, and felt similar to how I might imagine a heart attack or stroke. My friend called the ambulance to arrive quicker.

40 minutes after calling they arrived, and put a kit down on the table full of gear and instruments and put electrodes over my chest and kept me talking. At one point I didn't respond for a few sentences, and constantly lost my train of thought, unable to respond very well.

My blood pressure was 132/91 and my heart beat was 125bpm. I now believe it was that high to increase oxygen flow (because later on as I recovered, the oxygen level in my blood was less as my heart rate went down). So at this point I had no fever but extreme chills, I was rather extremely shaking from chills, and clamminess. They found my blood sugar was low (hyperglycemia) aswell which was weird as I ate well the night before and don't have diabetes of any kind and am in good shape at 33.

Basically my readings were borderline (though it doesn't feel borderline!). And they said that due to my age its probably better not to go into hospital and weather it out, and I was like ""so, explain to me why I can't breathe"" and we went through everything to the point it was clear that it wasn't yet pnemonia (as it would not come on that sudden) and that currently there wasn't liquid in the lungs, and I was getting decent oxygen. Seems fine right?

Well, I slightly recovered after that first hour, and I let the medics go and decided that if it hit me again hard like that I'd go in, but for now I'd tackle it on my own.

But, it came and went in waves. I believe my body kept releasing endorphins or hormones in waves, and when those hormones came on I became very calm, and then it would receed and the anxiety and feeling inside my body was so intense that I describe it like... I was fighting in a boxing match winded, getting hit to the body, and being forced to then swim in water with limited ability to breath. THEN fever hit, and chills, and violent cramps, and extreme feelings of anxiety and honestly wanting to scream or cry... Horrifying... like some saw movie.

BUT, I was conscious, and breathing, which was what I focused on. I focused on being calm, and held myself together. I sat upright to help my breathing, and drank apple juice, sodas, etc to make sure there were no other things compounding with it.

It felt like... a stroke or heart attack in how suddenly it hit and how little control I had over such a vital function as breathing. BUT if I was calm enough, if I kept my energy level up, I could maintain my hold on it. In the peak of it my face went red, and my friend almost called the ambulance again but I told him to give me a minute first. And I was violently shaking, but felt like... I felt like my body had ""spotted it"", and it felt like blood was rushing through my body at a far greater pressure and everything sort of fizzled and burned hot. And then it felt like the grip on my lungs released a bit.

By 14 30, I could breath half okay again and wasnt teetering on the edge of consciousness. It had begun at about 6 30 (when I was woken from my sleep by a clammy strange silent feeling).

And as I measured my heart rate as I recovered it came down to 95, then twenty minutes later 91, then later 87, then 85, then 83, then 75... and the hormone waves kept hitting through this time, so every so often I'd get knocked out like I was injected by a sedative, which relaxed me and improved my breathing but then everything got intense again.

Then, it washed away. I had to be careful and move slowly, but it slowly turned into what feels like larangitis.

My tips are this:

Peoples symptoms will be different, but if you have shortness of breath, that is the hardest part to deal with

If shortness of breath is sudden onset, try to keep calm and conscious and get someone to watch over you. Do a distil pulse test to check your blood oxygen saturation (some mobile phones can do this, but the paramedics have them too). If it is above 95% you are probably okay, lower and you might need a ventilator. I thought at the time that if you have difficulty breathing and are about to pass out, that this is because of low oxygen levels. I don't know what makes breathing so unbelievably hard, or what makes you nearly unconscious, but if you CAN stay conscious, do so, by regulating your breathing, staying calm. Make sure you have eaten, drunk, and the virus hasn't somehow strangely affected you. 

Continue to drink as it improves how much blood you have in you, and eat. (I mean I didn't want to, everything tasted horrible, and I wanted to throw it up, could barely taste or smell).

Stay in the moment, have a friend there if you can. Ride it out as controlled and without panic as you can.

I was prepared to keep feeling that way for a week, but luckily it stopped, then afterwards, all the pent up traumatic pain of it all came flooding out in an outpouring of emotion. If I wasn't such a tough guy I would have started sobbing for hours because of how utterly world shaking it was.

Explaining the feeling:

My condition was upper moderate, I am young

The feeling was not like a cold, flu, or normal virus

It felt to me, like a heart attack or stroke, or extremely severe anxiety attack mixed in with it.

It felt like a serious disease, like some tuberculosis craziness... horrible. Traumatizing.

Reiterating the tips:

Stay calm, have someone with you, try to keep conscious, maintain a pacing in breathing. Make sure you have eaten, drunk... and if you aren't sure, sugary liquids like apple juice, etc get absorbed quickest. Have tons of water.

You won't get pnemonia on the first day most likely, so don't panic. If your blood saturation is above 95 you probably dont need ventilators. If your heart rate is like 125, try to be calm, hopefully your body will kick in with endorphines or adrenalines and relax you in waves so you can better breathe.

Everyone's symptoms will be different. How should you deal with that? Get facts and help if you can.

Do not gaslight yourself that ""you are not sick"" if you are disoriented and short of breath, but also dont just react too quickly. Just get your friends aware, and have someone watch you, literally sit with you.

Do this and you can be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Opinions:

This would be utterly terrible for an elderly person, like throwing them into a boxing ring with mike tyson. IF they get moderate or above symptoms, with the breathing troubles... It just hits SO HARD it can send you into some kind of shock.

Do not willingly catch it. I would go so far as showering after shopping trips, definately wearing masks, and definately washing hands. Don't stay near anyone that is like ""its just a cold"", don't russian roulette it. And don't carelessly go near elderly with it. It is one HELL of a trauma. Like I feel like a legitimately need a bit of therapy. That really really really hurt, like some alien constricting my lungs from within. Hard to describe as anything but like black magic grabbing my lungs to terrifying life and death levels.

But afterwards, there is some light. I feel it ""pushes over"" as much as it beats you to a pulp. A bit like the war of the worlds where suddenly the aliens just disappear. In fact that movie, describes it almost perfectly.

127,1584905068,crusty_skeleton,How should I act after quarantine? What should I do?,"So I had some symptoms, but they didn't test me.

My symptoms started on March 14th. A little bit of cough. Then my throat hurt a little bit because of the cough, I could feel it being warm. It was also all red with white spots (still is). Then I could feel a little pressure on my chest and weird feeling inside, temperature 36,8 - 37,3 Celsius. No apetite.

So I've been staying at home since then. But I have to go to work on 26th or 27th of March, which gives me 12-13 days since the symptoms started.

8 days (since the 14th) and I still have a little bit of cough and my throat is warm. How should I act after this quarantine? Like I'm infected/can infect others? What if this was just a flu and my body is now weaker and If i get infected with coronavirus am I in more danger now because of this flu? Can I be infected twice? If yes, will it be worse for me than now? Did the scientists figure it out by now?

128,1584906485,tootsdafroots,Really trying to understand the actual personal risk to the 20-30 age group?,"There's a *lot* of information out there... and it's changing daily. We're now finding that young people are potentially at a higher risk than we thought before, numbers are getting scarier, but I'm still confused about what to think.

If the death-rate is between 1 and 2 % on average, like overall, the more people that get this illness, the more will die. The global population is 7.7 billion. If the rate of death remains the same and spreads to every single person on this planet, then very nearly 1 billion people could die. That's a huge number, obviously, we want to prevent this but I'm just trying to look at the big picture.

Even though this number could increase, if the death rate remains the same and the risk factors remain the same across the board, despite the increase in deaths, this does not necessarily mean that an otherwise healthy, young individual is any more at risk than they were before - when I mean by this is that I, an otherwise healthy 24-year-old female, am finding myself getting more and more nervous on a personal basis as the numbers increase.

Another thing to point out is that we really don't ever track numbers like this and publicize them as vastly as in this case. If you tracked numbers on other risky things, illness, behaviors, lifestyles, and publicized them live, every single day, those things could seem really scary too... Don't get me wrong, I'm not a flu comparison person, I'm just saying that numbers are scary and this is the *only* thing we're reporting numbers on right now. I'm not saying it isn't a real risk by any means, I'm just saying this is an additional fear factor.

Another thing that I'm really trying to wrap my head around is that the US is reporting higher numbers of young people needing hospital care... I'm wondering if this is because of differences in lifestyle, not only high rates of obesity and conditions like diabetes but also factors like vaping perhaps? I know we're talking a lot about how smoking didn't play a role in other cases around the world but we really still don't know a lot about vaping, generally regard it as safer, but again, this past year there have been a lot of complications due to it. Also, I notice that vapers smoke more than even the most chronic smokers because it's more accessible and less offensive to people so they can get away with it indoors. This is very prevalent in the states.

Additionally, on another US comparison, we don't tend to live with our elderly. We have a tendency to 'put them away' in elderly care facilities... whereas places like Italy have a more traditional family unit of multiple generations living together. Before we closed borders, before we took any other precautions in the US, we restricted access to these care facilities. We have a neighbor who just sold her house and moved to one several months ago and has been in a total lockdown scenario even before the rest of us were asked to self-isolate. 

Furthermore, the US hasn't been doing enough testing. We're saying that we're behind Italy right now but I'm wondering if we're equally as far along. More people travel in and out of the US than they do Italy, and when Italy became a risky place to be we brought all of our thousands of American study abroad students home. Would the higher volume of young people in hospitals highlight that the disease has actually been circulating for much much longer than we thought?

Then, going back to these numbers, we're now lumping 'young people' in a 20 to 54-year-old age range... that's HUGE. A 54 year old is most certainly at a different health profile than a 20 year old. They also aren't being very transparent about the prior health conditions of those young people in the hospital's pre-existing health conditions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am by no means saying that any demographic or group of people should be less cautious. We owe it to the whole world right now to social distance and stay home. We all need to play our part. I'm just wondering about these factors because, in the beginning, I was most worried about my family and less for my own personals safety.... now I'm getting worried about myself too... and while I should be concerned to a certain degree, I'm wondering if I could possibly, fundamentally, not really be that high risk.

I think that as panic ensues, as people's lives change and the numbers rise, personal concern and anxiety becomes worse for all of us... but I'm wondering if it needs to be that way. I'm also wondering if it *is* that way in order to keep people concerned enough to take this seriously. We told the young people that it was the older people who were at risk and they needed to do their part and not spread it - they proved that they didn't care, still going on spring break and out to bars. Now, in order to get them to cooperate, we clearly need to scare them about their personal safety too... right?",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fn5utn/really_trying_to_understand_the_actual_personal/

But I'm just feeling down about this whole situation.

I'm 17 and have a history of anxiety and depression. I left my public high school in freshman year to do online school because my mental health was so crippling. It was good at first but I quickly became very isolated. I have no friends. I don't go out much at all. I don't get invited anywhere. This past fall I finally built up the courage to apply to college to live on campus and finally be able to make friends and become a member of society again.

And now that it's actually happening around me, I have to say I'm handling it a lot worse than I thought I wouldve. All the stores and restaurants around me are closing. I'm just one week, we went from one confirmed case, to 96. And now we're sitting at 165, just three days later.

I work at a grocery store and I'm gonna have to take leave. My department was nonessential, and theyve unofficially shut it down and moved my coworkers to stocking and online orders. I wont be able to handle that, and I dont know if I'll get to keep what is the best job I've ever had.

And I'm extremely worried about getting sick. Like, I'm 20, in great health, with an efficient and well working immune system.

140,1584916251,nocte_lupus,Today turned out to be my last day at work and... I feel pretty ok?,"I work (non essential) retail and I've been feeling increasingly anxious and wound up over the past few weeks as the situation has ramped up and the pressure to self isolate or quarantine has increased.  

Where I work is a shop within a centre that typically around this time of year would be getting pretty busy as we move into spring, and we tend to get a lot of tourist traffic due to our transport links. Like we did really well over Christmas because everyone was gearing up for their Ski holidays and then about now would be the start of the like prepping for summer holiday/camping/festival season. 

However over the last couple of weeks visitor numbers have dramatically dropped, more and more shops within the centre have voluntarily closed and yet we had to stay open. Conversations with centre management were along the lines of 'We'll stay open until the government tells us to shut' despite the fact enough shops had closed that no one wanted to come to the place anyway. 

Head Office seemed to want us to continue as normal, but were doing things like cutting our music off, halting uniform purchases, encouraging people to go home early to save money, reducing our deliveries, restricting stationery orders and sending us gloves to wear to handle cash despite the fact the clear drop in customers was really obvious and it was really painful seeing the branch i work in which is usually one of the top performing branches in our area crash to the bottom of the leaderboard. Or seeing us only take a few hundred in in a day when on a good day I can take that in one transaction.

But this afternoon we got the head office email through to say we're temporarily closing up shop for however long (haven't been given an end date), we're being paid (Only contract hours after this months pay comes through which for me won't be much as I'm only contracted for 8 hours a week). 

Like I know things are going to suck for a while but honestly right now I'm feeling pretty chilled out? I'm also aware I'm in a better situation than some to ride this out (Live at home with parents, don't have to pay rent because I've never made a lot of money and was a student a while back). 

I found that like the potential for me to have to keep working my honestly totally non essential job and potentially risking myself and other people and also the increasing feeling of uselessness that comes when you work in a shop no one comes to was one of the major things driving up any Covid related anxiety I had going on. It was also digging into my financial anxiety as I've had periods of unemployment before and come from a family that's never been that well off and I'd managed to keep my current job for just over a year and even though the pay isn't amazing I was getting quite used to 'Wow I have money every month and can usually cover what I need' and then the potential of potentially being back in the unemployed area was just a big no.

But now I don't need to worry about work, I don't need to worry about money (sort of), I can focus on staying at home and doing my best to keep myself, my family and others safe for now.

I often take care of a dog for a friend who is a PA. However, I’ve had immune system related issues for about 8 years (doctor said it was chronic Epstein Barr, although I know that falls into the CFS family of issues, but know how it has impacted me for the last 8 years). 

Due to this, I told her I’d only take care of the dog for now if I could give it a bath (due to her high risk nature and the possibility of transmission via the dog fur, coupled with my existing immune issues).

Between realizing I cant work during this time due to stress, to my little sister coughing once sending me into a panicky, cleaning frenzy. I fear COVID greatly, and I dont know if I can mentally handle catching it. Being a confirmed case, just another number in the tallies, makes me panic, and the idea of being put in quarantine in a hospital, with no privacy, for doctors to come in and out and disturb my peace.... my sense of self and need for privacy would be greatly violated, and that would take a huge toll on my mental health. I've sort of assumed that if I contract COVID, I'll be a lost cause, mental health wise, and I'd just die.

But now I'm sort of wondering if maybe....getting sick wont be the end of the world. And maybe it could be...kinda better?

Right now, I'm 20 years old, pretty good health. I have a great immune system that is very efficient. I'm currently drinking lots of extra water, elderberry tea multiple times a day, and trying to get as much sunlight as this *insane springtime rain* lets me get. If I were to get COVID, theres an almost 100% guarantee I'll heal up fine.

The way things are going, in my opinion, it doesnt look good. My state is having massive jumps in cases every day, and we arent even close to peaking, countrywide. It could be the tip of the iceberg, and it could, in theory, go way downhill as the weeks go on.

So I'm thinking it could possibly, insanely, be good for me, a very healthy young individual, to get it now and be immune.

I'm tired of being fearful. I'm tired of worrying and tired of being so on edge, constantly. On one hand, it could be best to get it now before shit *really* hits the fan. On the other hand, I still have concerns. I dont want to infect my family members, and I dont want to be a confirmed case. If I had to go to the doctor, I ABSOLUTELY wouldnt want to be included in the confirmed case tally. It's just a weird thing I have.

Again, I fear getting ill. People say it's like the flu, but I've never had the flu. I wondered if, maybe, it would be milder for me since I am taking so many precautions and have such a good immune system. I wouldnt be so worried if it was more like a cold, I suppose.

I think it would be kinda brave of me to face such a big fear, and get sick and get over it with no issues. And realize I was just getting worried over nothing. But at the same time, I still feel like the disease is stigmatized, and I may feel embarrassed with catching it

I'm Swiss-Serbian. I've been living in Switzerland since I was 12 and I've came to Serbia to visit my dad in february, as I normally do twice a year.
Nevertheless, that was supposted to be a short visit, but coronavirus changed all of that.

I am a 28 year old male, living with my mother in Ohio. It's completely insanity how a lot of our lives have changed within a month's time... When the order came down from the Ohio governor that restaurants had to be limited to take-out, drive thru, and delivery only, I thought I would get my hours cut (I work at the Burger King in my town), but thankfully, I'm still working. My mom on the other hand (she's a food service worker at the local college cafeteria building here), she got word that she's basically laid off until the fall semester.

She's trying to get a job at the local walmart here for a temporary means of working until she's back to work at her regular job, at the moment, so I pray that she manages to get in.  I've been trying to keep the faith that things will get better, but it doesn't help when my dad keeps calling me just to insinuate that martial law is coming, and other things of the sort, and that he's kinda worried. How would you feel if you had a parent that's supposed to help YOU be calm and not to worry telling you that they're spooked and worried?

A little story to explain about my dad (if i tried to explain the whole thing, I'd be writing a book): the main reason mom and I are living together is because 14 months ago, we had to get away from my dad. Most of our lives (referring to myself, my mom, and my sister; my sister is a West Virginia resident now, married and has two girls, one being her stepdaughter), my dad was basically a toxic narcissist and he made our lives a living hell. He would go on tangents and rants about how people were out to sabotage his life, and would accuse us, his own family, of being in on it, and he just would go on, and on, and on, and on... Sometimes he would keep ranting into the night, hindering our sleep..

Fast forward to when I used to live in a trailer for 4 years, on the same property as my dad. By fall of 2018, my dad really started unraveling with his behavior. He would come to my trailer, pound on the door just to bitch at me about things I know I never did, and sometimes he actually got in my face, and I remember thinking he was actually about to get violent with me. Not to mention, he's actually thrown stuff at me before.

It was a miracle when I found a place to live for mom and I, and we were able to pool our money together to get it. We've been living in this cozy little apartment for 14 months, and we had been much happier and much more at peace than we have ever been. I thank God for that. 

I told that story to help explain how I'm feeling right now... It's just not fair.. We finally got away from him, but now this chaos that is this virus is sweeping across the world, and it's got people in such a panic that businesses and schools are either closing down or limited in operation. I don't remember seeing such a reaction during the swine flu days... 

I'm thankful to still be working, and I pray that mom will get in at Walmart (they actually want her working there, it's just that their systems are overwhelmed to where its slowing down my mom's process of getting in), because I am dreading the idea of having to pack my bags and go back to live on that same property with my dad. I just want to see my town go back to normal, to where I'm not seeing empty shelves in stores.

I am from NJ, M20, and am currently in CA where I was visiting my girlfriend before things really escalated here in the states. My parents are now afraid of the government ordering a domestic travel and ban and me getting “stranded” out west, away from my hometown doctors (which I don’t think really matters?). I am concerned that flying home is the bigger risk; my girlfriend and I stay inside all day and haven’t been in contact with anyone and have been very socially distant. I’m worried that flying home would not only increase the risk of me getting sick, but also the chance of me transmitting COVID19 to my parents.

The tri-state area also has even more cases identified right now than California; I’m not sure about what to do. My parents are very insistent and believe that the planes are safe and that I need to be home.

And maybe this is just my hometown. But I’ve noticed in the last few days that a lot of people have gotten downright nasty and are worrying wayyy too much about what others are doing, even in areas like mine where there is no official “stay at home” order. For example, a lady today called the state police on a church that was having a service. (The police did tell her they weren’t going to do anything about it.) People are getting angry at others who are walking or running together and not maintaining distance. (According to them.) I walked by a couple today who clearly weren’t six feet apart, but you know what I did? I kept walking! I’m not going to waste my own limited energy and stress on calling the cops or berating people who aren’t standing exactly six feet apart. I was talking to another Redditor who said their police department had to ask people to stop calling them about others having gatherings because their lines were getting overloaded.

I’m all for protecting yourself and your family right now. But I will never support people calling the police for meaningless reasons or squawking about others who may be four feet apart instead of six.

I don't know if this is nationwide, but there are no funerals , viewing or wakes at this time in my area.  

This person suddenly died (I'm trying hard not to think it was caused by the virus, since it it was listed as sudden severe illness causing organ failure and the person was under 65).  This person was a neighbor for over 10 years (they just moved a few miles away last year) , they had a large family so their youngest kids went to school with my kids and their older kids were teachers at the school and taught my kids. Normally I know the school would be doing something really big, but obviously that is not going to happen.  

I feel like it is impersonal and just not proper to just send an email or post something on the digital page. Churches are closed so can't light a candle.

158,1584924309,Scaryb0u,Just needing to get some of y frustrations off my chest.,"As post title says, this is just me needing to vent a bit and get some things off my chest regarding the current situation of things. I thank you in advance if you read all of this, because this is sure to be a very long post. I'm porbably not going to TL;DR it because I feel there is too much to say to shorten easily.

I live in Ontario, Canada, very close to Toronto (though not quite in it) and our cases of COVID-19 have been rising rapidly day by day. I work in the transportation and logistics industry, and my company is rsponsible for about 10k clients, most of them small to medium sized business owners who use our service to bring their parcels across the border into the United States to ship from USPS and other budget shipping companies that are mainly located in the United States. Smaller companies opt for options like this because it saves them money on their shipping costs (Canada is notorious for high shipping prices), which makes them more competitive on an international scale. The department I work in is client support, so I answer tickets and phones to assist clients with any concerns they have regarding their packages and the like.

As of a week ago, in response to COVID-19, my company has ordered all employees that can work from home to work from home (myself included) and enacted measures to keep our branch and warehouse employees who have to be physically present at work to accept packages and load the trucks and the like safe. These measures include things like removing the retail side of the branches altogether, and only allowing clients to drive up and drop off their packages outside, keeping things as contactless as possible. They've also issued disposable gloves and N95 masks and the like, and reduced our hours so we can have less staff on the clock, thus encouraging social distancing.

Obviously, the measures that my company has taken is comendable, and I really feel like I shouldn't be complaining, but I have been feeling a lot of stress that we haven't simply closed outright, especially since our CEO clearly understands the severity of COVID-19 and everything around it. We were told that in the event a confirmed case of COVID-19 affects the branch, staff will be removed, the branch professionally disinfected, and those of us who are presently working at home will act as 'backup' to replace sick employees. 

As someone with compromised lungs (I have fibrosis of the lungs from a number of years back, and they don't necessarily work at the capacity they should, on top of generalized asthma), who also has to take public transportation, I feel myself at a lot of unease at the idea of this happening, especially as cases in my area continue to go up and up and up. When asked why we don't simply just close, our CEO, who is the altruistic sort, said that outisde of the concern for the finances of the staff, we have received a lot of 'thank you for staying open' responses from our clients, as many of them are small business and rely on our cheap shipping rates to keep themselves afloat; many have even said that without our services they'd probably have to close up shop or worse, go bankrupt. We've even had clients provide us gloves and masks and the like, essentially saying, ""It might sound selfish, but you guys being open is keeping us in business right now, so the most I can do is help you keep being healthy so you can continue to be open.""

While I appreciate the sentiment from our clients, the idea that many of them are willing to have us be in harms way just so they can continue taking advantage of our services puts me at quite a point of unease. I feel worse knowing that our CEO is eating this all up, and because of these testimonials from our clients, that he will probably keep us open until we are essentially forced to shut down, all so we can continue ""being there for our clients.""

To compound on this stress, anyone who has done phone-based customer service knows that it is a very stressful line of work. You get yelled at a lot, and for every grateful client there always seems to be an ungrateful one. The logistics of me having to try and reach branches via phone when I have a question that needs clarifying has been shoddy, which adds onto the stress. Being at home with all of this stress happening, I have been finding it difficult to separate work from like and it is all blending into one, making my home no longer a safe space and instead full of negative association from my difficult job.

With all of this said, I understand I am one of the lucky ones who can work from home, and that my CEO does take COVID-19 seriously - but I am only one of the lucky ones for as long as the branch is healthy and does not need someone to come and cover them. This whole situation has been taking a toll on my mental health for fear of me being one of the ones who ends up having to be hooked up to a ventilator all because I had to come into work with my dysfunctional lungs because our CEO feels too much sympathy for our clients to close down for the staff's wellbeing. And I feel like I can't get away from it, working from home now.

Thank you again for reading this if you for this far - in this time of social distancing, I just felt the need to have my voice heard even if it's just to some people on the internet.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fnaspe/just_needing_to_get_some_of_y_frustrations_off_my/

160,1584925007,NatSurvivor,How do I calm down my mom?,"Hey guys!

I don't know if anyone is experimenting something similar but my mom is making me lose my shit and she is giving me more anxiety every day. She spends her quarantine days watching CNN 24 hours a day and reading Facebook and news about the virus everyday. She wakes me up at night to give me updates about de virus (even though I didn't ask her to do it), she comes to the room I'm in to tell me news about the virus (all her news are fake news for example today she told that she read that the quarantine in the world is going to last till April 2021), every time all the family spends time together she only talks about the virus and lastly I bought a book from Amazon which she instantly threw into the garbage outside because the package ""may come with the virus"". (While i was writing this she was beside me talking about patient zero in China)

166,1584927152,AlbertWhiterose,(Warning: long) I don't know how I can be strong for everybody all of the time,"It's 2am as I begin to type this. Everybody else in the house is asleep. I should be too.

I'm not worried about catching the virus. Well, I am - it would be foolish not to take it seriously - but that's not why I'm posting here. I just feel like everybody is leaning on me and I don't have anybody to lean on in turn.

I'm married. And I know Reddit has a certain reputation when subjects like this come up, so let me nip this right in the bud: I love my wife, she is amazing, she is good to me in more ways than I can count. But every human being has their own challenges and flaws -- and my wife suffers from a major phobia regarding medical matters of all kinds. 

It's not quite hypochondria, though that is a factor. It's more of an inability to function when faced with illness or injury. She can barely hand the kids a band-aid when they need one; when I once had a medical emergency that left me unable to stand I had to get myself to the clinic because she had frozen up, unable to acknowledge that it was happening. I have to schedule her yearly dermatologist checkup and not tell her about it until that morning, because otherwise she can't function during the preceding week.

So you can imagine how she feels during this pandemic. She's not lacking in self-awareness; she calls it her Kryptonite.

I've been doing everything I can to support her emotionally, and she's been amazing throughout. She's been taking care of the kids since the schools and the kindergartens and the day cares closed, giving me the freedom to do my job and support the family. But I have my own anxieties, and I know that if I reveal how deep they are to her it will severely harm her own ability to cope.

And yes, I'm afraid. We have five kids, and even though none of us are in a high-risk group (more on this later), there's still too much of a chance that out of the seven of us at least one will have a serious case.

I'm afraid, too, of what will happen if one of us parents catches it, or is discovered to have been in contact with a known carrier, because we have a robust case-tracking system here. If one of us has to go into up-to-two-week quarantine, how can we leave the other to deal with everything alone? (I honestly don't know whether it's worse if it's me or her.) And what if both of us have to - who will take care of the kids?

The kids. They're... well, they have good days and bad days. Our third and fourth are coping with the stress by taking it out on the baby and it's all we can do to keep them from sitting on her every time our back is turned. Our second is climbing the walls, desperate for physical activity that our three-bedroom apartment can't provide and that the general lockdown won't allow him. Our oldest has been so wonderfully helpful but for God's sake she's only nine. 

Obviously I can't show any of them the worry that I'm feeling. And they're constantly asking me questions about the disease. While I am all-too-happy to answer these (explaining complex concepts in simple language is probably my best skill), I know that the conversations are not doing my wife's anxiety any favors either.

Then there's the emotional tug-of-war between my parents and my wife's mother. I spend half the morning begging my mother-in-law to take the danger seriously, and then spend my afternoon fielding phone calls from my parents overseas, who are in hysterics and repeating every possible unfounded rumor of how the virus is going to kill us all.

My mother-in-law is over 70 and tonight she came out of the quarantine she had been in due to suspected exposure. She doesn't see what's wrong with letting her youngest son come and visit her tomorrow, even though he's been going to work every day and God only knows how many people he's come in contact with there. Every time I call her I manage to convince her to say no, but one sentence from my brother-in-law and she immediately capitulates to him. He does not live with her, and they have a very unhealthy codependent relationship; during the week she was in quarantine her psyche was the happiest and healthiest I'd ever seen it.

My father is a doctor who should know better, but he's been giving me inflated death-toll numbers, warning me that the virus is actually transmitted at distances twice the 2 meters that the government claims it is, telling me to beware the fecal-oral route (which is unconfirmed and doesn't even make sense for a respiratory illness), etc. My mother called me this afternoon and begged me to take the stairs instead of the elevator because the virus might be on the elevator buttons, as though I wouldn't have to touch twice as many door handles when using the stairwell. When I pointed this out she tearfully tried to guilt-trip me, saying, ""I knew it would be useless trying to convince you but I wanted to call you and try anyway"".

Constantly switching between ""please take this more seriously!"" and ""please stop exaggerating!"" depending on who I talk to is frankly exhausting.

Then there are the little things. Last week was the anniversary of our first date. My wife and I always celebrate that anniversary by eating at the table where I first proposed to her. 13 years of marriage and we've never missed a year. This year the restaurant, like all restaurants, was closed by government order. Who knows when it will open again. Not that we'd be comfortable with bringing a babysitter into the house right now anyway...

Finally, there's the virus itself. I'm not *technically* in a high-risk group, but I'm prone to recurring sinusitis and nasal polyps and I had surgery a few years ago to fix a deviated septum that was causing me severely constricted breathing. I don't know how that's going to interact when I catch COVID-19 and, yes, I'm afraid to find out. 

And I am praying, praying, that recent reports of COVID-19-induced ageusia turn out to be unsubstantiated or that the symptom indeed fades with recovery. Otherwise that might just kill me.

---

I have a mode of thought that I call Crisis Mode. I become laser-focused on solving the problem in front of me, put the issue to bed, and then shut down afterwards. 

For example, a year after we got married, my wife convinced me to go to a haunted house with her. Near the end we were attacked by a guy with a chainsaw; my wife shrieked and wanted to use the code word that let you use the early ""chicken"" exit. I went into Crisis Mode, comforted her, reminded her that it was an actor, convinced her not to use the code word, and we ran past him and made it to the proper exit.

She came out having loved the entire experience. Half an hour later I was shaking and swearing I would never ever ever go through one of those again.

We had a similar experience when my son showed some markers for Down's Syndrome in a prenatal ultrasound. I went into Crisis Mode and spent a full day alternating between comforting my wife and reading up on every single scientific paper I could find on those markers. By the end of the day I was an expert on exactly what the probabilities and dangers were in our situation. Using that information, we were able to schedule a follow-up ultrasound the next day that eliminated the concern. The day after that, I was an emotional wreck.

I bring this up because when you have a drawn-out, constant crisis like this, I'm forced to stay in Crisis Mode far longer than I can sustain it. 

This evening while everyone else was eating I used my diet as an excuse to abscond from dinner, go to the bathroom, lock the door, and sit sobbing in the corner of the shower where nobody could see me. I had maybe three minutes to myself before there were panicked cries of ""Daddy! Daddy!"". Get up, quickly wash my face so they can't see I've been crying, open the door. My son had somehow contrived to smack his face into a chair and cut the inside of his lip on one of his teeth. Nothing serious, but my wife couldn't handle it and I was called upon to step in.

I'm simply not being given the chance to recover emotionally and I don't know how much longer I can stave off the collapse.

Between realizing I cant work during this time due to stress, to my little sister coughing once sending me into a panicky, cleaning frenzy. I fear COVID greatly, and I dont know if I can mentally handle catching it. Being a confirmed case, just another number in the tallies, makes me panic, and the idea of being put in quarantine in a hospital, with no privacy, for doctors to come in and out and disturb my peace.... my sense of self and need for privacy would be greatly violated, and that would take a huge toll on my mental health. I've sort of assumed that if I contract COVID, I'll be a lost cause, mental health wise, and I'd just die.

But now I'm sort of wondering if maybe....getting sick wont be the end of the world. And maybe it could be...kinda better?

Right now, I'm 20 years old, pretty good health. I have a great immune system that is very efficient. I'm currently drinking lots of extra water, elderberry tea multiple times a day, and trying to get as much sunlight as this *insane springtime rain* lets me get. If I were to get COVID, theres an almost 100% guarantee I'll heal up fine.

The way things are going, in my opinion, it doesnt look good. My state is having massive jumps in cases every day, and we arent even close to peaking, countrywide. It could be the tip of the iceberg, and it could, in theory, go way downhill as the weeks go on.

So I'm thinking it could possibly, insanely, be good for me, a very healthy young individual, to get it now and be immune.

I'm tired of being fearful. I'm tired of worrying and tired of being so on edge, constantly. On one hand, it could be best to get it now before shit *really* hits the fan. On the other hand, I still have concerns. I dont want to infect my family members, and I dont want to be a confirmed case. If I had to go to the doctor, I ABSOLUTELY wouldnt want to be included in the confirmed case tally. It's just a weird thing I have.

Again, I fear getting ill. People say it's like the flu, but I've never had the flu. I wondered if, maybe, it would be milder for me since I am taking so many precautions and have such a good immune system. I wouldnt be so worried if it was more like a cold, I suppose.

I think it would be kinda brave of me to face such a big fear, and get sick and get over it with no issues. And realize I was just getting worried over nothing. But at the same time, I still feel like the disease is stigmatized, and I may feel embarrassed with catching it

170,1584930846,DollopheadedMerlin,Am I wrong to sanitize my hands instead of wearing gloves?,"I work at at gas station/convenience store that has a deli and whatnot. We have been deemed essential and are still open 24/7 (except for one hour in the middle of the night when we technically close to do a deep clean of the store). 
My issue, is that we had to sign off on a sheet that detailed what precautions we were and weren't allowed to take at work to help defend ourselves against COVID-19. Most of the rules set in place are pretty helpful and accurate. One of the things in this paper was a statement saying that we could wear gloves at the cash register of we wanted to but were not required to. 
Most of my coworkers wear gloves but me and a few others do not. The way we have our store set up, along with how busy we can get (even when limited to 15 people in the store at once), made me lean towards sanitizing my hands after every customer, rather than wearing gloves.
The way I rationalized it was: if I wear gloves, I'm either changing them super frequently, which is a waste of supplies that are already dwindling in places that probably need gloves more than us (hospitals, for example), or I'm leaving them on for an hour or two, which basically is just the same as not sanitizing my hands for the same amount of time. So, instead, I completely sanitize my hands between each transaction, which is entirely doable in my situation, as we are told to take our time with customers and also often have to take their order on what cigarettes they want. So, it is very easy for me to completely wipe down my hands each time I have a new customer. 
To me, wearing the gloves seems gross. It's almost like not washing your hands for however long you wear the gloves. I don't bash my other coworkers for wearing gloves though. We're allowed to. And if that's your preferred method for keeping safe, then absolutely. But one of my managers and some customers have been berating me for not wearing them, without asking or knowing that I sanitize so often. Some of my managers feel that the best way is to sanitize, so it's not like all of the managers agree that we should wear gloves. Many decide not to and understand when the cashiers dont (sometimes the managers are cashiers as well). 
Anyway, I just was wondering if anyone knew for sure if one way was better than the other. Coronavirus cannot pass through the skin, so even if it gets on your hands, it shouldn't be contracted unless you touch your face (which I have not been doing at all at work). Is sanitizing or glove wearing more effective? Are they equal? Are the both good in different way and you just gotta pick how you want to protect yourself? Please let me know if you have answers. Please source information if you think you have a definitive answer. Otherwise, polite opinions and advice is welcome.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fncecw/am_i_wrong_to_sanitize_my_hands_instead_of/

Yesterday &amp; today I woke up feeling a little better,I finally decided to tell my Mom I'm sick &amp; reassured her I was feeling better, only to feel just as bad as the night went on.  I hadn't told her because I didn't want her to worry. Note, I live alone. Last night I felt worse &amp; made a post on Facebook (hidden from Mom) that if I don't post anything today I probably died in my sleep. Serious concern; I'm no spring chicken, I smoke &amp; I have a few other health issues. I woke up to a call from my mom who was extremely worried, someone snitched. 

I don't have a PCP. I developed a distrust of Dr's after attempts to address my own health issues as well as the 6 grueling months of my Dad dying of cancer &amp; his Dr's refusing to even sign off that he had a terminal illness for medical cannabis. At least try to easy his dying, FUCK YOU UNITY POINT. He finally had to switch Dr's &amp; I stopped seeing mine. The final straw, me asking for anti-depressants but not Prozac &amp; her lying to my face and prescribing generic Prozac. I'm ranting &amp; this could be a thread of itself.

I'm a ""don't get sick"" person &amp; this does not feel like flu. Depending on how I feel tomorrow I'm going to try to get in touch with the local health dept or Prompt/Urgent care (whatever the one near me is called) but I don't have very high hopes of actually being diagnosed. I've heard so so many reports from people in my area that had symptoms, tested negative for flu, then were not tested for COVID and told to go home. Other even more disturbing reports, claims of people being told by health professionals they aren't testing for it more because ""they don't want it here"". Local ESDA maintains claims of no cases, Mounting evidence suggests otherwise. That's very disheartening. 

I'm more worried about my Mom than I am myself but after a week of sickness my anxiety &amp; depression are kicking into high gear. While my Mom may be in a high risk group, age, thankfully her job isn't as much, She's a cleaning lady &amp; horse tender for a rich lady. Still, it has her leaving the house. (IL shelter in place)

181,1584941002,pastacats420,Struggling tonight - advice appreciated!,"Hey!

I'm finding it hard to manage my anxiety tonight and wondered if anyone could give me some assurance or information on my current main fear.

So I share a room with my boyfriend at university halls in the UK. As you may know we're not testing here except in severe cases and that's playing havoc with my anxiety. Neither of us will ever know for sure if we have/had it unless we end up in the ICU.

I'm not so worried for myself, I'm mostly fixated on the idea of my boyfriend getting sick or dying. I can't stop picturing worst case scenarios and it's unbearable. I'm terrified I'll be the one to pass it onto him.

Some info - he's 22, overweight, possibly obese (not being mean about him, he knows hahaha), and neither of us have gone anywhere for over a week except for occasional runs to the supermarket for supplies (we're broke students so can't afford to stockpile). However living in such a condensed environment is scary and I don't know how likely it is to be picked up at a shop.

Weight is being listed as a risk factor now and I guess that's whats set off this spiral. I've had a few now and I've made peace with the idea of myself getting sick, I just cant bear it if he does.

I wondered if anyone has any advice for me, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you so much in advance!",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fnekrq/struggling_tonight_advice_appreciated/
182,1584944022,Desertmoongw,"Going back into my hole, don't know if I'll ever come out.","For the longest part of my life I've been a shut in, spending all of my time alone in my room doing nothing in particular, sleeping or wasting entire days away. I hated it, I want to be productive, work on things I enjoy but for some reason, maybe my depression or bpd or something, is keeping me from it. It's not that I can't work or that I don't want to work, I can and I do, but I just sort of... don't. Days and weeks and months went by where I would want to do something and never did. On the rare occasion when I did do something, it would be forever in between, things that would take a normal person an hour or two to do took me months because I just couldn't bring myself to do them, for no particular reason. It was absolute hell and I wanted to kill myself every day. Couldn't even do basic necessity stuff like showering or brushing teeth.

About half a year ago a friend started pushing me hard to seek treatment, and I started going out and getting therapy, getting dentist appointments to fix my broken teeth, doctors appointments to start hormone replacement therapy, and it was all going great. I was starting to build the motivation or whatever to actually work, I wasn't having emotional breakdowns every few days, and for the first time in several years I was starting to have a positive outlook on life. I started HRT, got about a quarter of my teeth fixed, managed to start actual daily routines of exercise and meditation, showering, brushing my teeth, taking care of myself, and while the therapy was a little all over the place going out and about every couple days certainly helped.

Then the virus started to hit where I live, Washington State, and everything was starting to go into panic. I had to be moved to a different therapist for unrelated reasons but the disease caused that to be postponed, and so did my next dentist appointment, and today I can't leave the house at all anymore. My only means of transportation is the bus, and I live with my parents who are just a few years short of officially being elderly and two very young sisters. Were already mildly at risk of catching it since my mom has to work in an environment of near shoulder-to-shoulder with no at home work, and with the places I need to go typically being mildly crowded and needing to take a very crowded means of getting there I can't head out.

So now like many others I'm isolating, I don't know what it's been like for others but for me it's familiar and painful. I can already feel myself falling back into my old habits. I slept 16 hours straight yesterday and haven't done a lick of work. My work is my own self imposed work, not a proper job, it's one I can do at home whenever I want, and I do want to, and I was starting to get on track to, but now it feels like I was climbing a rope out of a cavern only for it to be cut and now I'm falling all the way back down. I want to kill myself. I don't think I can handle being down here again. I think it's been a week or a week and a half since I've done my morning routine, my bad social habits that I was going to therapy for are cropping up again and it's hard to put them down. I feel disgusting. I was just getting my life on track. I know for a lot of people COVID19 has put a halt on their life, for me it's actively taking away months of work as I melt back into the state of sloth I was fighting against. My birthday is next week, probably won't be able to enjoy it let alone celebrate it, I'll probably spend it sleeping and then crying because I was sleeping instead of working.

Everyone is feeling anxious anyway. I've been visiting that [coronavirus stats webpage](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) every day, seeing the numbers climb. Looking at it all this time, it was just a load of numbers.

Today I saw the death toll had passed 15,000 people. Suddenly I realised, that number on the screen means 15,000 human beings died. I feel shook, that's just a huge number of people. I know it's spread out, but it's just hard to fathom so many people dying. It's unthinkable that this could happen in my own country soon. I know people die every day so it's a bit silly.

That episode started on Tuesday, the day after Emmanuel Macron made his second TV speech on the COVID-19 outbreak. (I live in France)

Apparently, shingles occurs either because of immunosuppression or ""psychological stress"" (I'm copy-pasting from Wikipedia here and it matches what my physician told me). I strongly suspect I became affected because of the stress generated by the outbreak, which I have been monitoring closely since January.

Another hypothesis is that I am infected with the coronavirus, without symptoms, and that my immunodefenses have been degraded. But my physician has told me that this a wild idea (""une idée un peu alambiquée"").

215,1584985190,avu-18,How to know if my immune system is weak?,"Hello all, 19 year old form India here. I was watching the interview of a renowned epidemiologist who said that given the population statistics of India, everyone will eventually be infected with the virus. Needless to say, this caused a serious spike in my anxiety.

I don't exercise a lot (only 10-15 min walking per day) , although I have decided to change my lifestyle for good. But I don't know if it's too late now. The food I eat is only minimally nutritious, nothing exotic. I am worried about the health of my family and me. We all have similar lifestyles.

My mom told we need to take steps to boost our immune system. But the more I think about it, the more I feel that the concept of immunity is somewhat ill-defined. There are sites online that only talk about boosting immune system, none of them really address the issue of determining its strength. Those that do only list severe conditions resulting from a weak immune system. I am quite sure I don't have any of those, although I used to have frequent flu-like symptoms a year ago when we were living in a city at a higher altitude and lower temperature than where we are now (just venting, I am not seeking any medical advice).

So is there a way to know for sure if my immune system is weak? Are there definite markers? I just can't stop thinking about this virus. I have my exams coming and I am not able to focus on my studies at all. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

We've got people who demand that we wear masks, that we sanitize more than an understaffed convenience store possibly could.

227,1584991650,LilyChickadee,Things that have helped me psychologically (4th week in quarantine),"I have been quarantining longer than many as I was afraid of this happening a month ago and had just gotten over a really bad flu.

Here are a few things that have helped me stay sane. 

-If at all possible, get yourself eggs, bacon, pancakes, orange juice.... whatever your dream breakfast is. I don’t know why, but it’s one of the things keeping me sane. Bacon on a plate makes me feel like everything is okay.

-set up a victory garden. Even if your live in an apartment, you can use pots to grow things like lettuce, spinach, herbs. I got it for “worst case scenario” but in reality it’s just something to do and gives me a sense of purpose.

-open your windows if you can. It’s spring. Leaves are starting to come back and birds are singing. A reminder that earth is still alive out there.

-don’t drink. The days I’ve drank have led to horrible depression the following day. I’d consider this life advice but it especially pertinent right now. Getting wasted every day is going to make you come out of this worse than before. This is an opportunity for growth, don’t let it be wasted

-remember the generations before you. Spanish flu, Great Depression, WWI, WWII. I always remember their sense of optimism and determination. I find great strength thinking of my grandparents. 

-in the same sense as above, learn frugality. Times are uncertain, and we should absolutely be using this time as a way to sharpen our self reliance. Things like gardening, basic fixer uppers, cooking. I have been saving all of my bacon fat just Incase we run out of oil/butter at one point. All of my veggie trimmings go in the freezer to make stock out of. Veggies don’t go bad—-if they’re about to, bake them or pickle them. 

Use this time to learn about yourself and how you’ve interacted with the world beforehand. This is a useful wake up call for many of us that relied on dining out and movies and clubs for entertainment. For people that don’t know basic skills like baking bread or making a simple meal, you have all of the time in the world to practice.

If I look at this like a prison sentence, I begin to lose my mind. If I look at it as an opportunity to sharpen my self reliance and to learn gratitude for the small things, I stay sane.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fnq6jo/things_that_have_helped_me_psychologically_4th/

I was not so worried about catching covid as, with seven major illnesses, I am ready to die. But I was more worried about being stuck out in the open cos that would be pretty miserable.

I've been estranged/low contact with my family for two years. My brother emailed to see if I'd come to his place to stay to be safe. I thought our relationship was getting better. So I agreed. Now I'm here and it's just the same. Pressure, put downs, and so on. We are just going into lockdown on Wednesday as a country. So at least four weeks of hiding in my room, then emerging, then having my ptsd set off, then retreating again. I've already lost the will to eat.

I want to go into the bush now. Even if I don't survive. Becusse as I said, I'm ready to go. I have a living will that says so. I just don't know how I could get into the Bush now because my brother would send someone to look for me. If I'd stayed where I was then I could have vanished and no one would have cared. But now I've completely fucked myself over. Also if I'd stayed where I was and happened to contract covid then I would have been able to refuse treatment. But now it would be harder to refuse treatment with family around. I'm sure they would pressure me to staying alive for god knows what.

Well moan session over. Basically I should have stayed where I was because I would have had freedom to go deep into the Bush and now I've completely fucked myself. Not only to four weeks of misery but also to potentially having treatment forced on me.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fnsyxu/i_want_to_go_hide_in_the_bush_but_i_dont_know/
240,1585004768,23Bologna,Advice really needed - helping a relative post-surgery (NYC),"I'm in a near panic over this. A relative of mine is getting an urgent surgery this week and I'm basically the best option in the family to go stay with her for a few days to help her out, but I'm not ideal -

I have no symptoms, feeling fine aside from anxiety. I've been out of work for a full week, so I haven't been on the train or in the office since then, and haven't spent any time with anyone. BUT I've been out grocery/essentials shopping a few times.

My question is, what's the best way to protect her from me, just in case I am carrying the virus without knowing it? I have an old P95 mask I can wear in the car or if I need to get close and help her get up or something, but it just isn't practical to wear it for several days straight. I plan on hanging out in the apartment as far away as I can from her, and basically carrying Lysol wipes around and swiping everything I touch. It's a small apartment so we can't be in separate rooms the whole time I'm there (and she isn't taking this seriously enough either, anyway, I can't lock her in her bedroom). I will be able to spend most of the time 6 feet or more away, but not 100%.

Any advice would be highly appreciated. I'm really scared out of my mind. How are actual caretakers coping with this?",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fnu23b/advice_really_needed_helping_a_relative/

Just packed my bags and will leave in the morning. My mum has chronic arthritis and can't move around a lot on her own, she also has 3 dogs. We have house help who comes twice a day, looks after the dogs, her food and everything else. However, because of the shut down, nobody is allowed to leave their homes. So, I'm moving back with her to help out till things are better. 

Looking at my sleeping husband just now, I suddenly felt so over whelmed and couldn't stop crying. The lockdown could last for months to come instead of the 2 weeks that are planned. What if he ends up getting sick or my mother gets sick... I am so worried.

Last night, I asked mum to get clothes from this great online sale I found and she replied that she doesn't want to, with the covid outbreak, who knows if she would be here in a few months... Hearing her say that out loud, it made me feel cold all over.

242,1585008337,Nitronejo,I'm a bit worried about people being jerks affecting others... including me...,"Well, on my state today we have 45 total cases (4 of them asymtomatic). But today was also confirmed the first death of COVID-19; it wasn't considered on the confirmed cases, it was discovered after the death. That hospital however, is under control of FEDERAL goverment, not state goverment. Nationwide we have a total of 316 confirmed infected, and with that death, 3.

Our state goverment take the initiative and started on early inspections, closing schools, events, etc. They have requested the population to stay 5 days at home if possible (Today is the 3rd one, and my bet is a 50% response). So on that part, seems bright, and considering that other states from the nation followed my state on early response, it's optimistic on some way.

However, the main worry i have today is this one:

My best friend was supposed to move back to live with her family at the end of March. Then she told me the householder allowed her to stay for an extra month due the contingency. BUT today she told me that the householder is evicting her this weekend, no matter what.

The problem is that she is asking me for help to move (She actually asked me since January), and aside of her family, she told me no one else is able to help her move (not even her boyfriend). I told her to try and negotiate with the householder, but the housholder argues that already have the new residents ready to take the apartment, so can't be delayed. Also, that actually the housholder wanted the apartment free since March 20 (Dafuq? For me that's a fraking jerk move!).

I don't mind help her, but the problem is about this pandemic. I have been trying to isolate, and i wouldn't fear to only go out for those 2 days exclusively to help her move. But i'm afraid that i could actually get infected. And also, moving back to her family will mean to be a few blocks away only where the first COVID-19 death registered on my city happened. I don't care about myself, but what i don't want to do is to get my parents infected too (They are around their 50-60s). They actually get mad that ""i got too close"" when someone was asking for a guy at our house and aproached me.

So, now i don't know what to do. I don't want to leave my best friend alone on this difficult time, but i also don't want to risk myself to allow my parents to get infected. ¿What could i do?",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fnv0zh/im_a_bit_worried_about_people_being_jerks/

244,1585013621,EdHuRus,I know our goal on here to keep positive vibes and be assured that this will come and go in due time but is anyone else worried about other affects from Covid19?,"I mentioned previously in my pro r/covid19 thread that I am disturbed at the pro-China posts on reddit and the doomer porn on r/coronavirus. I also mentioned about the increasing support for authoritarian measures in the name of stopping the virus.

This is a bit of a paradox since this is a threat to our public health and safety of the American people and we should definitely continue to follow the guidelines by your local health and state officials. 

Yet I am growing increasingly worried about how easily persuaded people are in giving up their civil liberties during a time of national emergency. I understand their side of why its necessary and reasonable but it doesn't mean its right. 

The Department of Justice, Barr apparently wants to suspend some constitutional protections such as Habeus Corpus during this crisis. If this goes on for months (doesn't mean that it's inevitable) we're looking at parts of our rights thrown out the window for a while.

I hope I am not causing more anxiety that's not what I want to do on here. There is light at the end of this tunnel. Over 100,000 people have recovered since this outbreak began and a lot more will recover from this virus. But let's also be realistic with the fallout that is occurring with covid19.

But keep strong everyone. A bit of an update from last week. Work officially closed on the orders of our governor of Wisconsin. They told us to file for unemployment but they stressed to me and to others that we are not being laid off. Thank god. We will resume operations at Goodwill when it is safe to do so.

TLDR: Virus worries me, and yes social distancing makes sense and we should take these measures.

245,1585014471,ExpertgamerHB,"Ex-anxiety sufferer here coming with a message: the brain is a powerful tool, but beware the monkey mind!","The brain is the most powerful thing we have in our bodies. I firmly believe fear to be our most primal and strongest emotion. Our brains are wired for self-preservation first and foremost. Anything that could cause our death should be avoided and that is what creates fear. Some fears are rooted in our very DNA it seems- arachnophobia is a good example. It's a leftover fear from more ancient times. At any rate, It's no wonder this virus sends anxiety levels through the roof for some. 

Buddhist monks say we have two minds. The first one is slow, one of logic and reason. It needs time to mull things over before reaching a decision on something. The other is the 'monkey mind'. Those who meditate might be familiar with it: it's the one that goes wandering when you're trying to focus. The monkey mind lives solely in the fast lane. It's spontaneous. It is stimulated by excitement, imagination and most importantly, in this case, anxiety. 

The monkey mind is more powerful than simply turning you into a nervous wreck. It can actually create real bodily sensations when there are no physical ailments. I had cardiophobia. I experienced shortness of breath, weird chest sensations, dizziness, fatigue, chest pains, heart palpitations... The typical heart problem indicators. But every physical test turned out negative. Blood tests came back A-ok. My body was 100% fine. My rational mind knew I was fine all along. But my monkey mind believed otherwise and made me feel things that weren't there.   
If your anxiety skyrockets because your monkey mind is running rampant with thoughts like 'what if this one cough is the beginning of the end?' and 'I feel hot omg I am having a fever!' it will surely make you feel all those symptoms and more. So how do you control your monkey mind?

Buddhist monks say there's one misconception about meditation: that you can truly empty your mind while meditating. You can't. They can't. The monkey mind won't allow it. **The trick is simple though: you must give the monkey mind something to do**. Ergo: *mindfulness.* The monks have their monkey minds focus on their breathing while meditating. 

Thankfully, practicing mindfulness is pretty easy. Imagine your monkey mind being a dog on a leash. Anytime it wants to wander off, you tug on the leash to keep it close to you. Every time your monkey mind wants to wander into the 'what if' section, consciously say 'no' to it (speak it out loud!) and consciously take in your surroundings. Then, move on to do something that you can occupy your monkey mind with. Watching TV, spending time with your family, working out, reading a book, listening to music, meditation, anything works really. Obviously, don't go look for more coronavirus news, it will only feed your monkey mind! Try to limit your time on this sub as well. The less you're thinking about anything that has something to do with this virus, the better you'll be able to keep your monkey mind tight on that leash!

I hope that this might help some of you deal with your anxiety for a bit. Though I do have to add, if you really have anxiety issues in general: seek professional help! I did this too for my anxiety and it has helped me immensely and got my life back on track. That's why this virus doesn't scare me as much. I approach any news with my slower, rational mind.

246,1585014780,picklesnake,"scared that I have it, scared of what it means for my family.","So I am pretty sure I have coronavirus. Here is my timeline up to date:

Wed 3/18--Start experiencing a stuffed nose and sinus pressure. Make some coronavirus jokes but ultimately felt fine since I had no other symptom.

3/19-3/21-- Feel fine other than sinus pressure. But when going to bed on 3/21 I started to feel an itch in my throat. Didn't sleep at all that night due to the anxiety. 

3/22--feel like crap but cant tell if thats because I am sick or because I didn't sleep. Spent pretty much the entire day in bed. 

3/22--night---As I start to fall asleep I get a cold flash. Somehow it felt a little different than the normal I am sick and cold. 

today--wake up with aches and am very tired. But otherwise starting to feel better. quarantine myself to the spare room while my wife disinfects the house----definitely should have done this sooner. then all of a sudden around 4 I get the worst coldflash of my life. Even with five blankets and a heating pad it takes me 20--minutes to feel warm. My body was shaking violently and my muscles and jaw hurt from the shaking. After I warmed up I eventually fell asleep for a short nap. When I woke up and took my temperature it had spiked to 103.1 and I could feel something in my lungs when I breahte/cough. 

So thats where I am now. I have called my county and they are doing a risk assessment for a test. While I normally have a healthy immune system and almost never get sick I am scared what this virus will do to me. I had childhood asthma so I don't think my lungs are in the best position. I am also scared for my wife. I am scared that I shed so much of it before starting to feel really sick that she will get it very bad We've been together for 10 years--basically my entire 20s so I don't know how I'd face the world without her. I am also scared of what will happen to our dog if both of us get hospitalized. We are in a new city and dont know people who can care for him.

He is also a pack-a-day smoker (unfortunately) so he still goes to the store every day to buy cigarettes. I also suspect that he has some sort of underlying health condition (very prone to headaches, body aches, cognitive difficulty, and fatigue) however he has a fear of doctors so he’s never really looked into it despite my urging him to. 

With all these things considered, I am absolutely TERRIFIED for him if/when he catches the virus. I keep hearing about how smokers are especially at risk due to lungs being comprimised, plus the fact that he potentially could have an underlying health condition, despite the fact that he is otherwise strong and in shape I have convinced myself that he would not be able to survive this virus.

I saw an ad on Facebook saying they're looking for employees at a small grocery store nearby (less than 10 min walk from where I live!!) and I wanted to apply there because I did try to apply there before but they never called me back. Today, however, they did. I don't have a job right now and I'm starting to get quite bored at home and it's making me depressed and anxious, which means my motivation is nonexistent right now. I know the store never has more than like 10 people there at a time (it's a small place and it specializes in vegan/organic products) so that's the main reason I wanted to apply there. 

But, on the flip side I'm kind of scared of exposing myself like this. Anyone else here is still working at a grocery store or gas station right now? Is it worth it? Also how should I prepare?

I was tested on Thursday and still have heard absolutely nothing from my state department or healthcare provider.

295,1585082642,reservoirdogma,I just want to die,"I've been trying to avoid the news but I've been reading it all at once today and I can't stand it. The only way I could psychologically cope is convincing myself that we would be out of lockdown and back to some state of semi-normalcy by June, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen anymore, and I don't know if the world we get out of will be one worth living for me. Humanity will probably survive but everything I love won't exist anymore, and if we're locked down past June I'm going to lose my apartment and probably also my job. I'm not going to be selfish and break quarantine, because people who want to live deserve to and I believe in the value of human life. But if we don't get out of this financially, I'm going to be stuck with my emotionally abusive mother all over again, and I swore to myself when I left the house that I would never allow that to happen. So I think I'd rather die after I had a few years of happiness then drag on living through an economic depression that will strand me at home forever and never let me have anything I've been dreaming of.

Part of me wants to wait this out and pray for a better solution, but the realistic part knows that isn't happening. I learned better than to hope for the best or trust that ""it won't be that bad"" after the 2016 election. When we inevitably emerge from this into a depression, I'll be one less mouth to feed. My death will help the world, by some small margin. Plus, I don't want to overload the medical system in case people stupidly try to save me, which might happen if I wait. I don't want an ambulance to come for me when I want to stay dead that could go to someone who has a fighting chance.

The only thing stopping me is my dad and my friends. I miss my friends, even though I'm convinced I'll lose most of them because we'll never be in the same city again and will fall out of touch, and I know they miss me. I don't want to add to their pain. And I'm worried about my parents, to.  I'm living with them now, and I don't care about my mom, but this will kill my Dad. I don't want to torture him more than this situation is torturing everyone already. I just don't know what to do and I don't know if I have the will to keep living if the news gets much worse. I adopted a cat three weeks ago but I think he's new enough that he might be alright if I left him with my parents. He doesn't know me well enough yet and considering that I don't know if I'll be able to afford to take care of him in the future, maybe that would be for the best.

It just doesn't feel like there are any statistics that can reassure me. I know SK and China are getting better, but America is so stupid and fucked-up I don't have faith that we can adapt their measures and actually recover. All the economic data points towards an unavoidable crash that will ruin my chances to ever live independently. My industry is going to be in the toilet, and even before all this, I struggled with the fact that I'm overweight and ugly, and me finding a romantic partner was always unlikely at best. Before, I told myself that I could at least live for my job if I grew up lonely. Now I don't know if I'll ever have one again. There's going to be hundreds of thousands of deaths and I don't know if I can sit by and lose everything, but I also don't want to make it worse for the people who love me.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/focsb5/i_just_want_to_die/

Keeping in mind I haven't had a flu in years at least 5 and I hardly ever get sick, maybe a small cold once or twice a year. My symptoms, I recorded as I roughly took a long time to think back and remember how I felt. To the best of my knowledge I believe to have felt them as follows and I know for a fact I was sick for 10 days at least, I haven't been that sick for that long since I was a child, I am 25, symptoms were:  


March 10th - March 20th: Cough, runny nose  
March 11th: Shortness of breath  
March 11th - March 15th: Fever 100+, highest 104, sweating  
March 11th - March 17th: Headaches, tiredness, fatigue, body aches  
March 17th: Severe sinus pressure  
I also had sneezing, occasional chest pain, nausea, phlegm and rarely some vision blurring usually accompanying the nausea.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel fine today, but, I am concerned I may have had a mild case of COVID-19. There are only a total of around \~35 confirmed cases in my area, I am on the border of 3 counties, \~35 is the total of all three of those counties and I am sure testing capability is low. My specific county having the most at around \~25. It doesn't seem like a lot, but with cases popping up everywhere it makes me wonder. Specifically because I live in a household where I am the only adult of 5 adults without a comorbid condition to COVID-19. Basically, all 4 other adults I live with have conditions that are high on the list of conditions that when mixed with COVID-19 cause a person to apparently become severely sick and turn into a matter of life or death. These conditions include, high blood pressure, brain issues, heart failure and more. I also have my almost 2 year old son who has a heart murmur. I am deathly scared for all of them and myself.   


Is it possible I could have had it? I can't sleep or stop thinking about it... I heard the flu has been going around as well in my area. I wrote it off as a flu and I am hoping that is the case. However, nobody else has gotten sick, though it seems some may be becoming sick and I've come to understand that COVID-19 has a longer incubation period than the flu. I am not a scientist, just a worried father and soon-to-be husband. I have been trying my best to get the facts by following a few governors and the president, WHO and the CDC. I find here and there evidence that people believe the virus may have been around for longer than we though, creeping into our society. My point and question in conclusion is:  


TL;DR do you think we could have been exposed to this virus and its spread has been at work since February, March or maybe sooner. That many of these mild cases are not seeking medical attention and spreading it unknowingly to the vulnerable and actually have been for weeks now?

It's a challenging time for all of us.

All the fear, uncertainty, and changes brought by COVID-19 are unprecedented. For most of us, this is the first time we ever encountered such unsettling disruption in our lives.

My experience is obviously personal. But I still want to share it thinking some might find it relevant.

If you are not feeling so well, I hope my story helps you realize that **you are not alone and we are all in this together**.

&amp;#x200B;

### Building Up Of The Breakdown

I wasn't feeling so well. But I didn't know that. I thought I was doing just fine.

After all, I was an introvert and sometimes a hermit. My day-to-day essentials were taken care of – I had enough food and toilet papers. Working from home and self-quarantine actually sounded appealing to the introverted side of me.

But something was off. **During the day, I wanted to focus and get work done, but I simply couldn't.** There were too many distractions, both online and in real life. So many COVID-19 related news flooded in from everywhere: friends' news feeds, work slack channels, DMs from family and friends, etc. At the same time, working from a dining table right next to the kitchen didn't help. I found myself constantly wandering around the kitchen, refrigerator, and the snack cabinet. A day went by and I hardly got any work done. I switched teams recently, so I pretended I was still ramping up on things to hide my low productivity. But as the week progressed, my guilt for not doing work built up.

Work was not the only struggle. **Life outside of work wasn't so great either.** At first, I was excited to make the most out of this social-distancing period. So many books I wanted to read, skills I wanted to learn, and side projects I wanted to work on. But I hardly made progress on any of them. Working from home erased the boundaries between work and life. I wandered around the kitchen when I was supposed to work. I felt guilty about not getting work done when I should relax and not think about work.

Most strangely, **I felt wrong doing things I originally planned to do.** I tried to pick up a book, but I didn't have peace while reading it. **It felt like the wrong thing to do.**

And of course, news related to COVID-19 did not respect my none-existing work-life boundary. They continued to flood in 24/7 constantly pulling my attention.

I started to stress-eat. I mindlessly chowed through bags of snacks, finishing pounds of pistachios in one setting.

I shopped impulsively as well. I felt like I was in lack of everything. Each day, I made multiple Amazon orders buying random things, from can openers to slippers.

### The Breakdown

One day, I finished the rest of the pistachios in the apartment and had a strong impulse to get more. I stormed out of my apartment and speed-walked toward the nearest grocery store as if my life depended on pistachios.

On my way to the grocery store, as I was anxiously waiting at the cross-walk, I realized I was getting out of control. I felt awful. My stomach was uncomfortably full. My heart was pounding. Thoughts were racing in my head. I somehow felt anxious, threatened, and insecure. I thought and pretended I was fine to my coworkers, friends and family, and myself. I was not fine, but I didn't know that.

I checked my phone. An email popped up titling: ""Sihui - are you OK?"". It was from Derek Sivers, a blogger I admired and followed.

That's when I finally realized I was not OK.

I was overwhelmed.

I have ADHD, and the recent changes to my routine have been hard to deal with. I usually can't stray too far from my routine, or I'll lose track of important tasks. Lately I've been transitioning to an entirely new routine, and it's helped tremendously. I have kept up my productivity for graduate school (and in general) by:

* Waking up before 10am and going to sleep before 11pm.
* Sticking to my usual meal times, and not snacking as much as I want to during the day.
* Setting aside 4-5 hours a day for school.
* Calling a friend or family member for 30 minutes a day, so I'm not totally isolated.
* Limiting my naps, and only sleeping on top of the covers. Sleep hygiene has been key.
* Not hanging out in my bed
* Tidying up at least once a day, my apartment can become very cluttered if I don't.
* Limiting my time on social media, it's easy to go down rabbit holes.
* Checking in with my SO at the end of the day about my productivity.

It's a scary time, and everyone is unsure of how to deal with changes regarding school, work, etc. Routine can help if the days are feeling long and confusing.

312,1585101908,ExpertgamerHB,Interesting Dutch article about COVID-19: why you can't take the number of deaths and death rate at face value,"I  just came across this Dutch article explaining COVID-19's current death dnumbers but with reason and a rational approach, and not from the 'millions will die from this' approach the general media has. It explains why you can't take the numbers of deaths and death rates at face value. Though, I must admit, it does not account for how the disease can possibly overrun our healthcare systems worst-case scenario. 

I've translated it to English, but it's still a long read. Nevertheless, it sheds a really good light on the current numbers provides good arguments about why we aren't at the mercy of this virus.  
[https://www.nemokennislink.nl/publicaties/relativerend-rekenen-aan-covid-19/](https://www.nemokennislink.nl/publicaties/relativerend-rekenen-aan-covid-19/) (The numbers mentioned for reference are based on those of the Netherlands, but can be applied to the West in general)  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Recent numbers say that at most, 1.4% of all COVID-19 patients die. Two third of those are over 70 years of age. But to see the impact of the epidemic, we must look beyond the mortality rate.**

While no one can predict how big the corona-epidemic will eventually turn out to be, a pandemic of a proportional size like this isn't unique. The comparison with the Spanish Flu, which caused 20 million deaths in 1918 and 1919, is too alarmist. Because it happened right after World War I, there being mass malnourishment from the war and the lack of antibiotics (to treat secondary infections), it's something from another age.

But more recently, in the 1968-1969 period, the Hong Kong Flu made its rounds around the world, where an estimated 1 million people died from. The outbreak had people worried and it made the headlines, but complete public shutdown and mass panic like what's going on now wasn't a thing.   
The reason is evident: the internet didn't exist yet. Both governments and the public were hardly conscious of the impact the epidemic had, and the estimation of total deaths was made much later. Life continued as normal everywhere, and therefore the epidemic had very little economic consequences.

**Case fatality rate**

According to the recent publication in Nature Medicine, COVID-19 has a Case Fatality Rate (CFR, the percentage of deaths vs. the total amount of infected people) of 1.4%. With those numbers, the illness sits between Spanish Flu (estimation: 2,5% CFR) and the Hong Kong Flu (estimation: 0,5%). That doesn't mean 1,4% of all infected die: current estimations say at least half of infected people do not notice any symptoms, and therefore don't know they are carrying it.

*\*Insert Graphic here\**

The number of deaths in Wuhan per percentage of all diagnosed cases, indexed by age group. People under 40 years of age barely have any risk of dying from COVID-19. The small bump in people younger than 20 years doesn't matter much, given almost no one within that age group gets sick. The three colors all indicate a separate estimation of the CFR solely in people who get infected and experience symptoms.

On the one hand, that's good news, because the virus is less dangerous than it seems. The bad news is that carriers (so-called superspreaders) can spread the virus too, which makes fighting the epidemic harder. That's likely the crucial difference between past outbreaks of previous novel coronaviruses, namely SARS in 2003 (774 deaths, CFR 10%) and MERS in 2013 (800 deaths, CFR 35%). Those outbreaks were quickly contained because only people who got sick could spread those viruses.

If there are 'invisible' spreaders of the virus, then all social life must be reduced to contain the outbreak, like in China, and now too in the Netherlands/world for the most part. According to the article (in Nature Medicine), it does work: the chance of an infected person infecting a healthy individual halved. When the article was written, it wasn't known yet how successful these containment measures were. Now China has reported very few new cases over the last week. 

**Fixation on number of deaths**

With such epidemics, the focus is mainly on the number of deaths. All around the world, COVID-19 deaths are getting tallied and new records are met with horror. And that's weird actually because for other public health issues the loss of years of life are taken in consideration (or years of life remaining corrected by overall health, so-called Qaly's or Daly's)

Because of the fact that COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly and people who have comorbidities, the loss of years of life remaining during this epidemic is relatively limited. Data of COVID-19 deaths indexed per age group, combined with life expectancy indexed per age group in the Netherlands, a rough estimation was made: an individual COVID-19 death loses an average of 17 years of life remaining, based on China's numbers. Based on South-Korean numbers, which are likely more accurate, one loses 15 years of life to COVID-19. (These numbers are not entirely statistically applicable to the West since the median age of the Chinese and South-Korean populations are not exactly the same to those of the West. (my note: it's explained a bit awkwardly, but in layman's terms, if you die from COVID-19 you had an average of 15 years left to live if you didn't get COVID-19)

Compared to Ebola or SARS, which generally affect all age groups equally, the average loss of years of life remaining is between 30 and 40 years. AIDS is even worse because infected mothers can spread it to their newborns, meaning an average loss of 50 years of life remaining. If COVID-19 were to affect all age groups equally, it would lead to an average loss of 40 years of life remaining.  

A loss of 15 years of life remaining is the upper limit by the way because it assumes that people who die from COVID-19 are all equally healthy. And this is certainly not the case, as most deaths are in people who already had underlying health conditions. Mainly obesity seems to be a risk factor because it corresponds with high blood pressure, diabetes and the body being more out of shape. These people have worse life expectancies than the average person in their age group. 

**Worst-case scenario**

In the worst-case scenario, where 60% of the Dutch people will get infected and half of those get sick, 0,014 x 0,3 x 17.000.000 = 70.000 people will die from COVID-19 in the Netherlands. That sounds like a nightmare, a nightmare the Netherlands hasn't seen since WWII. 

Yet, that's wrong. In the Netherlands, 150.000 people die each year to what are considered 'natural causes', namely a variety of diseases. The spread of these deaths over the age groups is relatively identical to the numbers of COVID-19; most already had underlying conditions for years, 75% is over 65 years old and 25% is older than 80 years. 

So if the epidemic completely goes out of control, it will cause an increase of about 50% of natural deaths in 2020. Then the epidemic has run most of its course. The rest of the populace will be younger and healthier so that the rate of natural deaths will be lower in the following years. After 5 years the composition of the population is almost back to normal as if the epidemic never happened.   

**Public Impact**

The current death rate of COVID-19 is not even close to these numbers. In Hubei, China, with a population of 60 million people, the epidemic seems to be over. The number has been stuck at 81.000 people infected and 3200 deaths. This sad record has since been broken by Northern-Italy, with 41.000 infected people and 3400 deaths.  

The numbers sound dramatic, but they are far fewer when compared to the winterly peak in natural deaths that happens every year. In the Netherlands, this peak means around 10.000 extra deaths. In Northern Italy, which has roughly the same amount of people as the Netherlands, this shouldn't be that different. So even the worst-hit region in Europe, COVID-19 is a cause of death at the same rate as other natural causes of death. 

This reasoning comes across as cynical because it ignores the personal suffering of all people who have lost loved ones to these natural causes. It's purely to see the public impact of this epidemic in a reasonable way. Because there are no winners with mass panic. Private sorrow is sad, but just to look at the current number of deaths is too shortsighted.    

An epidemic that randomly picks and kills people (like Ebola or SARS) or sometimes even picks out adults in their prime (AIDS) has a bigger impact on a social, economic and emotional scale, compared to flu-like epidemics who mainly affect the immunocompromised and the elderly.  It's more rational to see this epidemic as a temporary increase in the 'death of natural causes' numbers that is happening all the time. Of course, this article is not a plea against fighting the epidemic, after all, we try to fight the other natural causes of death all the time as well.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/foi5de/interesting_dutch_article_about_covid19_why_you/

I’ve been anxious since the virus became public knowledge earlier this year. I was checking Worldometer daily and reading the news constantly and watching it grow to now has been absolutely staggering and disheartening.

Currently, I’m living at my university in Ohio (I’m part of a small group of students approved to stay on campus). Our state is currently under a shelter-in-place order, which I have been and will continue following. I’m an introvert, so luckily, this hasn’t been a difficult twist in lifestyle.

My anxiety, though — which previously took a backseat in my life — is crashing back into me.

It comes in waves. I’ll feel optimistic and hopeful throughout the day. I'll be so positive to the point that negativity seems impossible. But suddenly, I’ll feel the exact opposite. There’s this constant urge building inside of me to check the latest news and numbers. I’ll become preoccupied with something, but when that ends, I’m reminded that all of this is happening, and I HAVE to check the latest news.

I’m a student journalist, which hasn’t helped at all. COVID-19 has been a regular presence in my job, and it’s crammed into my social feeds. Yes, I understand some mainstream headlines exemplify the negatives of a situation (emotional appeal) to increase its audience, but the content is typically factual. It’s reality in your face, and I wish I could get myself to stop staring at it so much.

I keep modeling what could happen to me off of these stories.

I’ve been pretty shaken by the stories of younger deaths from the virus. There's been several of these stories coming out the past few days, especially. A lot of these people are reported to have underlying conditions, but some of them are reported to have little issues, and sometimes no conditions prior to death. These are people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, the ages of many of my loved ones, and they seem to be too common compared to statistics (which is likely a result of journalistic media). I feel so broken by that.

Regardless, any death at any age is absolutely horrific. It’s saddening just how many people are dying from the disease in such a short span of time. It’s hard to accept how many people are just suddenly not here.

I’ve been taking all precautions to prevent infection, but fear’s unrelenting.

I just turned 20 on the 5th, I’ve never have had a severe respiratory illness or condition, and I’m lucky to have a strong immune system, but I’m slightly overweight and previously had an obese BMI. I was diagnosed with prediabetes in 2018, but in response lost nearly 90 pounds and lead a healthier lifestyle. Lately, however, my eating habits/weight have taken a rough turn (stress eating, anybody?). I’ve been trying to make healthier choices again; I’m just afraid I’ve got an underlying condition I know nothing about that’ll kill me if I catch COVID-19.

Regardless, I’m much more worried for my family:

\- My mom and dad are in their mid-50s. My mom’s very healthy, and had a illness eerily similar to COVID-19 several weeks ago. My dad’s overweight and takes medication for high blood pressure and allergies. He recently had surgery for prostate cancer and is cancer-free as result. Regardless, I’m terrified these health problems will ruin his chances at recovery if he caught it the virus. I know that sounds pessimistic, but I can’t get it off my mind.

\- Several people in my family are overweight, diabetic, hypertensive or have previously smoked. One of my grandparents has skin cancer, and another has COPD, which are high-risk qualifiers for severe COVID-19.

\- My 21-year-old sister is beginning her nursing career in the midst of the pandemic. I’ve heard several stories regarding a nurse’s susceptibility to a large viral load, which worries me to no end. - My 50-year-old stepdad is a paramedic, which puts him at high risk of infection.

I just can’t shake the mindset that this is all some cruel, meant-to-be twist in reality. Like some disturbing wake-up call to my own mortality and the mortality of my loved ones. Our lives were all going quite well beforehand, and this comes and completely dismantles it — it feels so intentional, like I’m living out some disturbing script.

Honestly — I feel disgusted saying it — with all the health conditions weighed against my family, I feel like I’m inevitably meant to experience a loss during all of this. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it’s an occasional mindset I can’t seem to shake. I feel like things couldn’t keep going well, so a life-changing event has to come and remind me of life’s unpredictability. I know that's not the right mentality to have, but I don't know how to get rid of it.

Overall, I’m just looking for any comfort, reliability or factual information that can help me in this situation — specially with my fears regarding my family. What has helped you guys through this? I know some of my thinking might come off as irrational, and I apologize and hope it’s understandable. I'm trying to stay hopeful, but it's been a tug-of-war.

Thank you if you’ve read through everything. I think it’s essential to support one-another during these times, so anything means the world. I hope to provide support myself as I learn to cope with this situation, and most of all, I hope all of you are staying safe!",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fokotw/need_an_outlet_for_anxiety_looking_for_any/

I do the shopping and pick up anything necessary and so on.

I was wondering if anyone knew of anything he could do to boost his mental state? Hes gone for walks, and done stuff outside and away from people but that only goes so far.

I should also mention, he doesn't cover his mouth when he coughs(hes a smoker, so he coughs alot, but you never know), no matter how much I tell him to, so Im sure that would play a factor in where he can go",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fokz69/what_can_an_immunocompromised_63_year_old_do/

327,1585115936,aristhought,"Why even introverts are struggling with self isolation/quarantine - it’s not about being alone, it’s about the loss of agency and control.","I came to realisation last year when I was quarantined for pneumonia induced sepsis (fingers crossed won’t happen again this year), that it isn’t always so much the being alone part that is so unsettling about being forced to isolate.

Being alone is a factor, but the crux of it is the loss of agency. Anyone can joke that they spend all their time alone in their room anyways, but the key difference is that they’re still in control. They can still see people if they want to. They can still make their own choices. They can leave if they want to, even if they don’t do so.

Meanwhile, if you are forced to stay alone at home now, with no other choices, you have lost control, autonomy, agency, and choice. Apart from the isolation that may drive loneliness and rumination, the feeling of your own life no longer being in your own hands is difficult to handle, to say the least. 

Interestingly, agency is at the centre of individualist cultural values, and this may correlate with why people living in collectivist cultures found it easier (though nonetheless a difficult time) to adjust to a sudden loss of daily agency. And why some people living in highly individualist cultures (such as America, Canada) are finding it very hard to emotionally come to terms with what’s going on. 

Nonetheless, things will be okay. Brains may take time to adapt, but they do.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fol7au/why_even_introverts_are_struggling_with_self/

336,1585134150,andipales,I'm exhausted and food sourcing is now my full time job,"My days start at 5.30 when a panic attack wakes me up, after that, I get to spend a couple of hours desperately attempting to source food via the internet for the 9 people I know who are either at risk or in total lockdown because they would not survive it if caught. I am one of those people.

There are no delivery slots online, all the supermarket sites crash daily. Sometimes I stay up into the wee small hours because the sites are less swamped then and occasionally I get lucky and manage to find a slot to put an order in for someone.

We are bleeding money, my husband is the only one who managed to keep his job, so I can't send him to the shops because if we lose his income we are all screwed. The financial package the government put into place wouldn't cover us and benefits wouldn't even touch our bills. Besides which, the guidelines say he shouldn't be out because he risks bringing it home to me.

Somewhere around 9am, I get to get to stand under the shower and cry for five minutes, then spend a half hour getting all the pets cleaned and fed, whilst wondering if I have enough food for them. How would I know, we have no idea when the country will come out of lockdown.

My mother has cancer and COPD from the radiotherapy, the pharmacy is refusing to deliver her essential drugs so I had to ask a community group to try and fetch them. The pharmacist has contracted covid19, we have no idea when or if we will get those drugs my mother needs. My father is 70 and frail. They cannot leave their house and I cannot leave mine.

Every day is the same, I get up, I fight endlessly to get food to people, family, friends, whoever needs it. We bleed more money, we ration the food we have in the house. This is not living, it's surviving and it's hellish. 

Many of our friends and family will die from this and there is nothing I can do. This will break me. I have no idea how the fuck I'm supposed to carry on like this for 12 weeks, I barely recognise myself in the mirror already and it's been 3 weeks. I don't even have it that badly compared to other places, my heart bleeds for places like Italy and Spain at the moment, I can't even fathom the agony of their situation and I know it's coming to us in the UK too.

Having been in this position before, I know how little the Embassies actually do for most nationalities. 

However, we live in fluid times. While airlines have shut down, countries lock down and transits look to be halted what do these tourists do? Then also will have to hunker down. 

The biggest worry for many is a loss of income and no more insurance. Most travel insurance companies will not cover a pandemic nor if you've been in a country past 10 days in an emergency. 

In my view, and I am asking everyone here for a brainstorm on alternatives, at the very least foreign offices should support stranded tourists by A) promising to cover any medical treatment they may need overseas B) financial aid eg, social care as per anyone back home who has been laid off work or so forth. 

If we went the whole hog and ask for travel insurance from home countries then it would bankrupt any nation. So at the very minimum medical care or coverage for COVID-19.

351,1585154714,snailgorl2005,"I had an important realization this morning. (long post, sorry)","I got up pretty early this morning- around 7 AM. I take a medication that must be taken on an empty stomach, so the first half an hour of my morning is usually spent checking social media while waiting for my medication to start working. This morning was no different until I noticed that some birds were chirping outside. This is common. I live in New York where winter could end in March or it could end in May. We're also the epicenter of the outbreak in the US- I live in Buffalo which has marginally fewer cases than NYC does.   
So, I usually don't pay too much attention to the birds (other than sometimes being annoyed because they're loud and wake me up before I'm ready to be awake). However, today I just kind of stopped and listened to the birds chirping. 

And I just listened for a few moments.

And I suddenly felt this sense of peace.

I realized that the birds have no idea what's going on in the world right now. To them, this is just a normal day. Maybe they know something is different, but it's not bothering them at all right now. They still migrated back to the area because it's getting warmer outside now. 

It gave me a huge sense of hope. Winter sometimes lasts longer than we want it to, and sometimes it ends a lot sooner. It can be really unpredictable. If you've never lived in the Great Lakes, especially in Buffalo, we can get some horrible winter storms that close schools, cause power outages, make it impossible to see when driving, and leave us trapped at home. Sometimes they come in with very little warning. Sometimes they even bring thunder and lightning. Some of the damage from these winters is fixable. Some of it is permanent. 

What is certain is that the birds *always* come back when the winter ends. We may not know when exactly that end will come. Sometimes we think it's over, then it comes back with a vengeance. But the birds still return. To me, the sound of birds chirping outside is always a sign that warmer days are coming- that better days are to come. 

Now, the birds can't tell me *when* this pandemic will end. No one really knows that. What it reminded me of was the fact that, like winter, the pandemic *will* eventually end. Just like the birds do at the end of winter, we will eventually return to our normal lives, even if things are much different. We are all feeling some sense of anxiety, fear, maybe even anger or frustration. I wanted to share this because just tuning into something I don't usually think about helped me to realize that in a world where so many things are uncertain, what is certain is that the pandemic and being quarantined are both *not permanent.* 

The birds are still out there doing their thing. Even during a disruption of their usual routine, they still return to living their normal lives. Humans are a lot more complex than birds- I get that- but we, as a species, are capable of rebuilding and returning to normalcy once the worst is over, even if that normalcy is a different from how it used to be. It's going to take time, and that's okay. 

We will adapt.

355,1585159127,WillSuckcessSpoil,Should I stay or should I go?,"I'm scared.

I feel really really lucky in that I have a wonderful job that I can continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. A lot of my friends lost their source of income, including my roommate.

A year ago, my roommate expressed to me his desire to move out of our two-bedroom NYC apartment when our lease expired April 30th, 2020. My roommate was my best friend, but we had sort of grown apart and always seem to fight over whether to renew the lease. It seems that every year there's another bad decision pulling him away - last year, he wanted to quit his job and go live in a different city with his girlfriend. ""Hardship is necessary for growth,"" he said. But I like it here and had a lot of anxiety at the prospect of moving or finding a new roommate. I was terrified of having to give up and go home to Long Island. I just wanted to cling to the status quo, and he kept going back and forth with his decision until what felt like the last minute. He decided to stay for one more year, but promised me next year he would leave.

Now it's next year, and he's leaving. In spite of losing his job and the directive to ""stay at home"" he stubbornly refuses to to abandon his plan to move, even though it means signing a lease for a much more expensive place after I even offered to help him with his share of rent if he stayed, and got the landlord to agree to a month-to-month situation. Nope. He ""needs"" to get out of here, and annoyingly romanticizes the future struggle he put himself in. He feels he gave me plenty of time to carve out a new living situation by April 30th, but given what's going on in NYC it feels like he gave me no time at all.

So the way I see it, I have four options:

1. **Find a new roommate** \- this is hard because no one is as stupid as my roommate in NYC and no one is looking for a new place. I have tried though and I have a few candidates who are also jobless and need a room, but it's unclear if my landlord would let a jobless person sign a new lease. Further, I wonder if I really want to be quarantined with a stranger for that long, especially if it turns out they aren't taking this seriously. There is one guy I feel pretty good about, however, but there is no guarantee anyone will be reliable and supportive in this situation to a degree I need them to be. I feel pretty jaded on roommates. At the same time, he's a trusted friend-of-a-friend in the exact same position I'm in: so shouldn't I try to help him?
2. **Find a new place** \- probably bad. I don't want to uproot myself into a completely new situation now. Also, not a whole lot of places available in my area and I'm not going to travel around NYC to look at places in other neighborhoods. I can't afford a place by myself and realty has ground to a halt, so the only option would be other roommate situations. That, therefore, carries the same issues as choice 1.
3. **Go home** \- I'm leaning towards this one. My dad has a vacant basement apartment I can live in at home on Long Island. But Long Island is bad too, and my dad still goes into work every day with no hope of stopping. Rumor has it there is also COVID-19 spreading in the office where he works, since employees there commute from NYC every day. I'm worried for my dad, and feel like I'd be stressed out wondering if the whole house will come down with it.   
If I get sick, I'd rather be with family, and for sure I can eat better and save a ton of money living there. But I can't help but feel I'm much more likely to get sick if I go there. He'd have to pick me up, drive me and help my move - my lease is ending so if I leave here I leave for good. The virus has a high incidence within households especially since my dad is not and will not WFH. It could easily spread through my family and to me, and for all I know I could get it just being in the car going home with them. My mom's house is too small to self-isolate and she also cannot fully WFH, but she might be stopping that soon, so it could turn out to be safest, but what if I'M the carrier, bringing it to her?  
Of course, my job also will remain in Manhattan. So I'll have to go back to NYC eventually and go through an apartment-hunting process eventually.  
There's no where I can go where everyone is isolating 100%, or where I feel I'm able to easily isolate, unless...  

4.  I burden myself financially to **live here by myself** without a roommate month-to-month until I feel comfortable letting someone move in. This would kill 90% of my paycheck and if I got sick alone here I think I would feel the least safe. But I also can't help but think my odds of getting sick are lowest with this option. I just have to consider my mental-health and finances. NYC is bad now so it feels like a bad place to be alone, but I almost feel like this crisis makes me too scared to live with others. I just don't know!

I just wish my roommate didn't make this decision. Honestly, I'm having a hard time empathizing with him and am not sure our friendship will withstand this. But I need to let that go. What do you guys think I should do?",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fouuzk/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/

0,1585181539,Thekellbelle,"I'm not sure fully if this allowed, if not I will happily delete it. Desperately need help getting bare essentials (ignore the couple that aren't) items for my baby. Details below","Tldr: Broke, issues with husbands job, family now unable to help, obgyn warned incredibly unlikely I'll make it past 34 weeks, currently 25,have nothing but a few clothes, am completely broke atm. I hate this virus.
(please no hate on me not being able to afford my child please) 

So on Halloween we found out I was pregnant. We are/were not ready, but decided to continue with this pregnancy happily because she is honestly our little miracle. I was told at 17 I had around a 1% chance of ever conceiving naturally, so we were simply thankful for her. 

We thought we were okay. We had 1000$ in savings, okay insurance once I hit 15 weeks, and my husband had an okay stable ish job. All of that has since changed. Our vehicle keeps breaking down every few weeks and fixing it has used up all of our savings. Our insurance has decided none of my now many medications will be covered. 

All this money we thought we would have to prepare for our little girl is gone. And now we are having issues with his job. They refused to close their store front (he works front and back) until this Friday. We had a shut in order placed on Tuesday. He decided to take Tuesday and Wednesday off, and have his weekend on Thursday and Friday and go back in Saturday when the chances were less. 

I am very high risk. I am pregnant, have diabetes, have asthma, and an auto immune disorder due to a skin condition. I hate it but it is what it is. Every time he goes to work it puts me and our unborn child at risk. He had 15 hours of pto we thought would be more useful now, than when I gave birth. This morning his job called him. Upset he had been calling out even though they told people they wouldn't be getting in trouble for it if they felt it was unsafe to come in. 

They informed him that they are now forcing anyone who calls in for feeling unsafe, to take a minimum of 7 days. To dissuade people from just taking a vacation, because getting pto is almost impossible for them. So now our next paycheck will be even shorter. None of our debt places will take late payments. 

Due to what's going on our family (his I have zero contact with mine) have mostly lost their jobs, or desperately need the money they are getting to stay afloat. So having a baby shower to try to get things is unfortunately out of the question. 

This pregnancy, though a blessing, has been a nightmare. I had a bleed at 12 weeks. I had the flu, strep, and a sinus infection all before 15 weeks. Then I got diagnosed at 17 weeks with gestational diabetes. I have pre existing high blood pressure. Then at 23 weeks we thought we were losing her because I started leaking fluid, thankfully I wasn't it was just bacterial vaginosis but it was just another thing to go wrong. My insurance won't cover any of my insulin or testing supplies, or my blood pressure medication. All of our ""extra"" money right now is going to that stuff. 


I am making prefold cloth diapers, a few onsies, and some cloth wipes, and burp cloths from extra fabric and old clothes I have around the house. I'm not buying maternity clothes at all, and just altering what I have and wearing a lot of dresses. We are trying to get by with as little as possible. 

Unfortunately due to everything I've had going on with this pregnancy at my last ob appointment (last week) my wonderful ob sat me down and explained my chances of going full term, of even going past 34 weeks, is very unlikely. They are sure I will develop pre eclampsia at some point. My blood pressure just keeps going up, as do my meds for it. 

I am freaking out that at almost 25 weeks I have only a few clothes for my little girl. If anyone is able to help I put a list together with a few bare needs, and one or two would be wonderful to have items. We have a family member who is willing to loan us their used car seat (no accidents not expired yet) and our insurance will thankfully cover a breast pump. If I'm not producing in the first 24 hours, my hospital charges the insurance company and gives you free formula. 

If anyone is able to help, or even point me in a better direction for help, you would be a literal life saver. This is causing me so much stress.

1,1585184249,Serpente-Azul,The truth of covid-19 from someone recovering,"I want to do my best here to get you in on the ground floor.

Just a quick overview of my situation. I am 33 and had some of the worst symptoms of covid-19 you can get. I however had no complications and so did not need a ventillator, meaning my case is moderate. Though I did require hospitalisation and this is how my infection was confirmed.

I have had some time now to consider how everyone is feeling, what people really fear, and all sides of this crisis; from the health staff, to the patients, to those with mild symptoms, and those with complications, to those at home without enough information.

In short I will explain that covid-19s hardest hitting symptoms can absolutely affect the young (if you get them), and there is nothing saying you won't get the worse symptoms because of your age. The difference is in the COMPLICATIONS those symptoms can trigger. So, I was told, that my symptoms were ""right in the middle of the worse cases"" and ""if you were 20 years older... it would be another story"". However, my body was able by some miracle I don't understand, hold off infections like pneumonia, and hold off complications.

At the second recurrance of the worst of my symptoms I was hospitalised in something called a hot zone. This is for people with a fever over 38, there are warm zones 37 and above, and cold zones 36 etc. In this zone I was taken into an isolated treatment bay, where about 8 vials of blood were taken for different tests, and I was given xrays for my lungs. 

At the time my heart rate was 125, and I was short of breath, but I was able to remain calm, and get enough oxygen. In the bay across from me was someone else, also with a heart rate of 125, but not okay. It was a stark example to me, of how the same symptoms can have a different IMPACT.

And this is when covid-19 became clear to me, that the distinction is not in symptoms, but in the complications that they create. This is where disaster strikes from. Just one weak link and the bombardment can show its cracks. And it is not an unsignificant bombardment if you get the higher end symptoms.

I realise this might terrify some of you who suffer anxiety, but I say it in order that you not be under prepared. And there is HOPE in this reality, even though dark. Hope to understand the disease and what you see around you, and hope in how to get through it and what to expect.

So let me get into how that hope comes about and how you should react to the disease if you get it.

Hope comes in the form of symptoms being different from complications. You can have the worst symptoms, but be checked for complications, and after monitoring, and patient recovery be cleared (as in my case). And understanding comes in the form of knowledge that pneumonia is the most common complication. Though this can change and I expect that is why they took 8 vials of blood instead of 1 or 2.

We can treat pneumonia, and this is the biggest source of hope out there when you are worried. And even if scans come back with it, there are good chances of you fighting it off.

While it is true we have nothing for covid-19 itself, we CAN face its complications in many cases.

How does this help us understand what is in the media?

Well, there are things that are wrong... Namely ""it is a cold, or a flu"". No, the symptoms are not like that at all and can hit so ungodly hard that it will shake you to your core. But that said, that is the SYMPTOMS not the outcome.

OUTCOMES are similar to the cold and flu, (given treatment) because we can mostly treat for the same or similar complications.

These muddling up of these two facts is the reason for disinformation. If you assume the symptoms can only be as tough as a flu, you will get cocky (far too cocky about this disease) and you will be shocked when someone as young as 21 dies. But if you understand that the symptoms can be quite extreme, you will understand how much pressure a person is under and why complications might occur in the young.

The symptoms, are however distributed on a scale. Right now the scale is measured in literal temperatures but I am sure that will change as they get more understanding of it. If you get low end of the scale symptoms you will just feel a bit weak, maybe have a few bursts of a few hours of bad fever or symptoms, a few aches, etc. Mid range, you might feel short of breath, nausea, lose appetite, cough a lot (some have fits of coughing others dont), get a high fever, mild disorientation, fatigue, and headaches. High end of the range, shortness of breath, inability to speak, move, go about normal activities, not be able to feed yourself etc, shaking, disorientation, confusion, (amongst other symptoms, cuz there are a lot of symptoms that come on and they differ for different people).

Most of the symptoms show around the 4-5th day, it might be only for that day, it might continue, or it might reoccur, and in the 7th and 9th days are when complications seem most likely. 

I was hospitalised on the 7th day mostly in order to check for complications as my symptoms were very severe, and basically were similar to a heart attack according to paramedics who were making sure it wasnt one, and friends who looked on.

8th day now... the onset of symptoms today were bad but... only for an hour, and weren't so bad as the day before and certainly not as bad as what I had on the 4-5th day. I must be vigilant in these coming hours and days, but I know I am going to be okay.

So, I wish to give you some of my strength and resolve.

If you are afraid,

Do not fear the unknown out there in the media.

KNOW the facts.

Symptoms will be on a scale, those symptoms will change over the days of the infection, and while they are bad and they may cause you panic, do not panic, instead be smart. Moderate to mild symptoms are unlikely to cause complications but you want to make sure, preferably with your GP if you are registered for one, as they can give you antibiotics for any complications early on, where paramedics and the like cannot. And the hospital will be dealing with life and death, so not have a lot of time to spend with you in the hospital bay. So if you can, it is more comfortable to use your own doctor. BUT if your symptoms are severe, I think it is probably a must to get it checked out with xrays and bloods.

Understand that this virus, is very physically demanding. And in turn you must react intelligently. You must use your wits, and stay calm, in all situations. You will not have the energy for worry, or deep thought, all your oxygen will be going to your cells to help fight the virus.

My number one tip is this... support from those who live with you. And checkins from people who know you over messenging services. Have them wear ppe (protective equipment) but having people there can help you overcome hours of otherwise staring at the wall trying to keep calm (you wont be well enough to listen to music or talk, or think at all if your symptoms are significant enough).

Be careful throughout the entire two weeks. And find ways to comfort yourself. For me it was sitting upright cuz I had less pressure on my chest, and soft slow breaths, no fast movements that would rise my heart rate more (I listened in my body for my blood pressure rising and kept it low)

Remember, the symptoms are not like the flu, the outcomes can be... BUT, know that because the symptoms are significantly more physical than the flu significantly more worrying and frightening when intense enough, that complications are less predictable and this requires vigilance and support through the process.

Knowing all this you should be better prepared.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fp25s8/the_truth_of_covid19_from_someone_recovering/

It's been stressful, with online classes on top of everything, but I'm managing well, I think.

The four of us were renting out a house a few hours away, me, my buddy, her (his girlfriend), and a friend of hers. She's working at a hospital, under a contract for another year, that she has a laundry list of complaints about; thin staffing, poor pay, awful hours, and a lack of support for nurses in general seem to come up a lot. I doubt she has access to any kind of suit, might not even have masks: I haven't spoken to her too much recently about her work. She had been making up her mind about quitting, and despite not taking this very seriously before things may have ramped up to the point where she goes through with it. I hope she does. It's understandable for a person to panic at the idea of medical staff leaving en masse, but I won't wish for my friend to put herself in harm's way. What's worse, the hospital is a ""teaching hospital"" that serves as a sort of overflow protection for other hospitals in the area; they're light on experienced staff and support for them, and heavily burdened by the flu season we're already going through (which is apparently quite bad this year).

The viral load you're exposed to matters in how sick you may get, right? There's a difference between having your faced coughed on working over a dying patient, possibly without a mask on, and, say, touching a chair somebody not yet displaying symptoms touched hours prior. Yes, you'll possibly get sick in the second and, yes, you'll still have to face some possibility of dying, but the statistics we've seen out of Italy and China about medical staff and infection rates is really disconcerting. She and every other nurse is potentially in line to be the next forgotten national tragedy, tens of thousands of women and men sickened severely working in a system that doesn't support them properly.

I feel guilty, too, for being grateful to be with my father. We may get sick eventually, yes, but I'm not nearly as worried about myself here as I was there. I was, not without reason, still, scared of the likelihood of catching it from her. I'm glad I'm not living with her right now, as worried as I am about her, and I don't like that feeling. I also feel guilty for being frustrated with her over this, the virus. She wasn't concerned about it: didn't start following it early like I did, and I kept to myself about it for fear of seeming panicked or worrying others. It's just the flu, more worried about the panic, media exaggeration, less air pollution here etc.. I wish I had tried harder to convince her to be concerned. I also feel like, if I had, I would feel guilty for scaring her and my other roommates. I wish there was something I could do. I have some masks I won't need I'm going to mail back, but I've been hearing some hospitals won't let nurses bring masks from home! That's outrageous. I wish I could do more for everybody. (Just want to add, not a hoarder; only bought a pack of 10 masks. Now that I know you can sanitize them, with heat or iso alcohol, I want to give most away)",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fp29yg/one_of_my_roommates_is_a_nurse_in_an_understaffed/

This June I was set to graduate from college and start working my dream job that I’ve wanted for 6 years. It’s been pushed off three times throughout the 6 years. Life happened 🤷🏻‍♀️ Last year I found out about the program and got in right away. I’ve been kicking ass in school and was ready for clinical rounds. I was going to be a surgical technologist.

Welp the virus was getting worse and worse and the hospitals stopped taking students. We were told hopefully May we can go to clinicals. I’m angry that my plans have been pushed off for who knows how much longer. I was hoping to live with my boyfriend and start living my life. Now it’s all fucked up and I just want to scream and cry. 

Today I’ve been on the verge of tears. I’m just sad that it’s all been out put off again when I was so freaking close. Part of me wants to give up but I know I have to keep chugging along. I just want this whole fiasco of a virus to be done. I know everyone wants it to be over. It feels like there’s going to be no happy ending in the world again.

10,1585188919,KLWK,I think I figured out exactly why this is making me have panic attacks.,"I am immunosuppressed, have asthma, and have bronchiectasis, which, basically, is a form of COPD. I'm used to my lungs not working so well on a normal day, and I cough a lot just on general principles. I use inhalers and a nebulizer semi-regularly. I also run a fairly low resting temperature of 97.1 and don't get fevers easily- last time I have pneumonia, I was running 99.8 in the hospital.

So, when I get sick, because, despite the fact that I'm socially isolating (12 days and counting), I'm under no illusions- I will get this illness eventually-how will I know I'm sick with it? I could just have a cold. And how will I know when things are starting to get serious enough I should be hospitalized- as a matter of course, I've had to learn how to treat things at home, under doctor guidance, of course.

I don't know if I'm getting cabin fever but I've been getting more irritated with my family mostly my mother. every day I wake up to Covid19 this Corona that, a constant update on how many people have gotten it how many have died, which country is at the top of the Most Corona Chart. I get the concern but since were inside anyway can we not focus on it all the fucking time. Then there's the extreme focus on home remedies and other stuff I just don't believe will work in being shoved in my face. for example, my sister boiled some lemon skin with onions and other stuff and told me to put my face in it while it's boiling because it will help my lung or breathing. Then there's my sister daily insults calling me lazy for sleeping most of the time and staying in my room all the time but what am I supposed to do my mother owns the tv in the living room watching African movies or Spanish shows and I don't want to be around that I so I stay in my room. My room which I share with her not that she sleeps there but treats it like her warehouse for her online business, you couldn't do a proper push up in if you tried. But the worst thing of all is at night its hot and theirs no air conditioner when I ask my mother to open the I'mwindow they say no because she's scared of the virus so I sleep hot and sweaty. And when I get up in the middle of the night to get a cold drink from the fridge (which I do a lot) She's yelling at me for doing it saying I can't drink anything cold and got to keep myself warm (which I get but I think it's harmless since I'm not sick) but i'm getting real tired of the drinking something cold is gonna get you sick and then Corona. Due to staying at home all day and not being that active even before the corona outbreaks my astma condition is getting worse, so since there is no ventilation since the(cuz closed windows) I suggested going outside to get some fresh air note not talk to or be around anyone just get some air and be away from my family and my mother and I get into an argument. she even agaiinst me going outside with my older sister for a food and supplies run. I'm kinda getting stressed and don't want a huge argument since were going to be in close proximity for god knows how long.

I don't know my family is the only one having trouble during this time. Here's some background before getting into everything:

My dad has been unemployed for almost a year. Things were starting to look up, and then because of the virus, everything has gone down the drain (it feels that way at least). My family gets along relatively well, but it's hard having my dad home 24/7. My mom and I are both EXTREMELY germaphobic (my psychologist says I might have mild OCD). Therefore, this has been really hard for us. 

Unfortunately, my family has been arguing a lot and it's just been really hard. Today I lashed out on my father and I feel awful. I can't sleep because I've been crying all night, and I have online school tomorrow. The anxiety of everything going on right now plus the tension in my family has made things so hard. 

Does anyone have any advice? I don't use Reddit that often, but I'm really in need of some help.

19,1585196367,PapaSmurf204,"Should we let my partner's mom stay with us? She has no where to go, but we can barely fit into this place on our own as a family of three.","So, amid the global COVID-19 panic, our small family has suddenly had a bit of a wrench thrown into our lives. I live in a very small place, with my spouse and four-year-old daughter, in Winnipeg, MB. My partner had a call from her sister today, where she basically told us we don't have a choice but to take their mom in while my partner's uncle self-isolates for two weeks as per the Government of Canada's orders. He is returning from the Philippines this weekend.

We are both young (I am 29 and she is 27). It is one of those re-purposed attics, with the slanted ceilings as walls which hang over the room. We are already bumping elbows constantly and argue about clutter, dust, and picking up behind ourselves. There are piles of laundry just sitting in the middle of the hallway which my daughter has tripped over and hurt herself with in the past, while I sit around and work and my partner does her schoolwork from home. The couch right now is covered in clean piles of laundry that have not been sorted since the weekend. I try and keep up with the mess, but every time I spend an entire day cleaning, I basically leave for a bit to come back to the exact same mess and clutter all over again, the cycle never ends.

Now, our primary issue is that, with our place already being so small, we don't want to be mean and say no—we always try to do the right thing. I am already stressed the hell out and can't stand being in this place because of the dust and constant mess of toys and clothing that my partner and child leave laying around. We have considered moving but cannot find a place with reasonable rent that has access to a garage and basement laundry room like we do here.

I am one of the lucky ones who has so far been able to keep my job, but I am working from home and cannot fathom the idea of having another person living with us for at least two weeks while being stuck here all day (she is also very messy, leaves a bigger mess when she visits than my daughter does). We do not even have an extra bed nor the space for one, and when she sleeps here they usually pull out a foam mattress topper that we stopped using because I found it was not helping my back problems. That alone is another source of constant dust every time it is pulled out, and they put it away every morning because my daughter's room is basically the size of a large walk-in closet, and she (our daughter) needs her own space. It drives me absolutely nuts every time they do this, and I have brought it up and recommended or even offered myself to sleep on a yoga mat to no avail.

The home she is leaving from so that my partner's uncle can self-isolate in is owned by him and my partner's sister. He lives on the top floor, with a bedroom that is possibly bigger than our entire suite (it takes up the entire second floor, just like our suite). The place that the sister is going to be staying in is their grandma's, who also lives with *her* mom who is turning 100 years-old in about a month. The idea is that they leave him alone at their house, and everybody else stays with the grandparent. The problem there is, that my partner's mom is not on good terms with her own mother, and is not welcome to stay in their home. She would also be one of the ones to be considered a high risk if she contracts COVID-19, due to previous health and substance abuse issues, and then there is also the 100-year-old great grandma the rest of the family will be staying with.

I don't want to be an asshole, but two weeks in a confined space with someone who leaves such a great mess behind, in addition to the busy student spouse I already live with who leaves her clutter everywhere while I sit at my desk and work the days away is my idea of a nightmare. Seriously, we had to stop letting her mom clean when she visits because she just throws everything in the wrong places and half the dishes she washes come out just as dirty as before. She leaves crumbs and clothes behind, and has even left Nutella spread all over the counter and jar in the past on a regular basis. I love our relatives, but just *not* as roommates. There are reasons that her own mother will not let her stay with her, so it is not just me who feels this way.

Does this seem fair, and would it be wrong to turn her away? Am I just being crazy? One thing thing that really bugged me is how my partner's sister basically TOLD us, like THIS is what is going to happen. They OWN their family-sized house, while we rent our humble little hobbit hole. What can we possibly do to make this work?

20,1585198237,theloneliestfamiliar,Is anyone else triggered by ‘We’re all going to get it eventually’ comments?,"I guess those users mean well, but it’s incredibly triggering for my anxiety and OCD.

For one, I have 4 family members that have a high likelihood of dying if they catch COVID-19. I have my own health issues and no way of predicting what it could possibly do to me, but I doubt it would be mild. I’ve never had an easy time recovering from respiratory illnesses, and I have allergy-, anxiety- and exercise-induced asthma. 

To repeatedly read that I’m isolating myself for (probably) months but I’ll end up contracting the virus and potentially being hospitalized is terrifying and depressing. I just feel so uneasy thinking that all these measures aren’t for my health, but to ensure I’ll have a respirator  available to me when I’ll eventually need one. I haven’t slept well in weeks from the fear of getting the virus more than the sadness of isolation. At this point, I’ll be willing to remain isolated for all of 2020 just to not get the virus. 

TLDR: anyone else feel super triggered when they read those comments?

21,1585198476,ette212,Voluntarily living apart from my SO for now,"My boyfriend and I made a mutual decision today that he will go live at his dad's house for the time being. For some background, I have been essentially isolating at home for over 3 weeks now - I'm fortunate that my company got on this early and I have the opportunity. My son's school closed down the last week of February (also proactively), before the rest of the state.

That being said, there are a few reasons we decided to do this.

1) He works for UPS, which is definitely essential - thankfully not handling individual packages, as he works at the airport loading and unloading large cargo planes, but there is obviously still some risk.

2) He's just not taking it quite as seriously as I am, and I have been essentially nagging him every day to wash his hands immediately and take a shower. I don't want to keep doing this, he's getting annoyed, and ultimately I can't control his decisions. He's not taking it LIGHTLY by any means, but I really don't think he has any clue how serious everything is. He just doesn't freak out about things in general, which is both great and also frustrating.

3) He and his dad are also continuing to work on their real estate photography jobs, which again, there's usually limited to no contact (primarily vacant homes) - but this is not essential and I don't agree with it.

Since he and his dad are probably taking it the same amount of ""serious"", it will be better for us temporarily. We've been getting into arguments because of my extreme anxiety and his lack of taking it as seriously as me.

Ultimately, we're doing this for the health of our relationship...but it's really going to suck and I'm already bummed because I know I'll miss him. It's just that the anxiety of missing him isn't as high as my anxiety about sanitation... 😑🤣😩We have no idea how long this is going to continue.

This is my personal experience with a loved one, on top of having family as some of the first responders in the NYC area giving us live updates. Both about the most recent knowledge about COVID-19 and about my Grandmother's condition/what to expect.**

Hey all,

I figured I would share this personal Facebook post I wrote to help others understand what others are going through. I haven't lived in NYC for about a year but I have moved back since I've learned about my grandmothers diagnosis with the virus. I plan on staying here until the final moments of my grandmothers life are complete and my family is at peace.

&amp;#x200B;

**This is my story I wish to share with you all:**[https://pastebin.com/xhfEMd3D](https://pastebin.com/xhfEMd3D)*\*\*Note: I shared the post originally but it is in my best interest to share a pastebin*

**TLDR; of Overview**

* Make it a point to show your loved ones you love them
* Go the extra miles for those who don't have much time left
* Be aware and understand the current situation when going out into the public
* As long as this virus lasts without a cure and remains a problem, please use your voice and call attention to the matter

I will confess, I never faced something like this in my life. I didn't know how to take it. Now that it took a drastic impact on my personal life, there is nothing I won't do to fight this. Everything I do is in remembrance of my Grandmother who is fighting this illness and ALL of those who are currently fighting it, have loved ones who are fighting it, and those affected by the economic change brought upon us by this virus.

Please post your thoughts below about this epidemic. Also please post links/posts to charities or anything which aids to treat and cure this virus. I am willing to donate money to any charity that I deem fit.

**Overview**

She meant everything to me, just that person you have indefinite trust in. This virus took that away from me. She had a time to go, but now wasn't it. She was healthy. I spoke to my mother everyday. I asked about my grandmother every so often (about once every week or two assuming I didn't travel back to be with my family during an event).  Before this, there was nothing alarming about her health and she was in stellar condition.

This virus took her from us quicker than a person can react from the snap of a finger. Without any goodbyes or support.

All we got was she was not going to make it. Then wait 48 hours and decide from there. And that is it. We can't be with her, speak to her, stay next to her bedside with her. Hell, we can't even give her the proper funeral she may deserve.

This is why I am sharing this post here. I have never felt ever so strong about this virus than I do now. She was my best friend as far as I am concerned. And hell, if I sit back and do nothing I will be eaten alive by my own thoughts. I need an outlet and this is it.

This is my open letter to you guys, make sure you build relations with your family. I know I sure as hell did after I lost my first loved one. Be prepared for the unexpected. Go that extra mile your family deserves to see from you. Make an impact. You'll never know when your last impression on a loved on was actually your last.

You should understand I am mad and upset.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fp75yx/how_covid19_affected_me/
26,1585210273,Magicbythelake,My mom is looking for relief after not sanitizing the bottom of a vase of flowers delivered to the house. Ideas?,"Ok so my mom and I are kind of having a hard time keeping a sense of reality on this whole thing because I have OCD and she is a germaphobe so I feel like this whole experience has been weird for us because we are already hyper aware of things and were working to not be so much on the alert. But NOW it’s like oh wait, actually never mind, be hyper aware about everything to protect yourself. 

We’ve been sanitizing everything we bring into the home or setting it aside for a week, like with mail. Probably more than other friends and family are doing, but not more than various credible sources are saying we should. But then yesterday was my moms bday and she got flowers delivered to her. Why the flower shop was still doing deliveries, I don’t know. I work at a flower shop and we stopped with the shelter in place rules bc flowers are NOT essential. 

Anyway, she sanitized the sides of the vase but didn’t do the bottom. I was like that’s fine just put it somewhere but don’t move it or touch the flowers etc. Well, she ended up putting it on the carpeted floor next to her door and and then sliding it across the floor, across the doorway area to the other side and then proceeded to walk back and forth through that area and the rest of the house. 

Now, when this action was realized it caused a lot of alarm in both of us. We’ve been so careful up until this point. Should we sanitize our whole house now? We have limited sanitizer and I wanted to save it for groceries. I mean, the flowers were outside last night and then she brought them in today so when they slid across the carpet it had been like 24 hrs. The concern is that she could have stepped on it and then walked all around the house. And I’ve been sitting on the floor, I have cats that have been walking around. I’ve accidentally touched my eyes a few times....So then my OCD kicks in and part of me is like I shouldn’t worry about this, but then there’s the part of my brain that is on overdrive thinking of everything that could be contaminated.

She is over 60, she smokes, and I am just waiting every day for her to call me and tell me she has fallen ill. 

She is there working in the hospital, being essential, and I am just sitting in my house sewing fucking masks because our government was too selfish and incompetent to bulk up our system in anticipation of this disaster. 

I try to just not think about it but I am staring death in the eyes right now. I'm only 29 and lost my dad two years ago. I haven't given my mom a grandchild yet. It just feels like shit and I feel helpless and useless.

29,1585222206,w_illmatic054,Three positive things in your life right now,"Hey guys, a little bit different from most of the posts on here.

Just sharing a little method which has really been helping me through this entire thing. Just taking 10 mins out of your day without any Internet, could be whenever your in the shower of if you work out, just after then, and finding 3 solid positives in your life right now and just repeating them to yourself.  It could be things you have started since in isolation like picking up an old instrument, or even reaching out to friends and family that you wouldn't normally have done if it wasn't for the situation.

What are your positives right now?  Mine would be:

1. Reconnecting with my family who I'm isolating with. I haven't really seen in the past 7 months or so. My little brother is now a full blown teenager and it's shocking me every day more and more how much I haven't seen him.
2. I've picked up some new software and I'm learning a lot about concept art, games design and animation (for anyone interested in that kinda stuff, there are a lot of free to use software up there which are taking the industry by storm and actually being used in mainstream companies, will link some in the description)
3. So far no one who I actually know has been infected (I know this may not be the case in 3 weeks, or even a weeks time, but it's right now that matters)

Big shout out to everyone who I've seen on here who have been diagnosed and are powering through it. Also anyone living in any major cities please keep safe.

I can't say this to my wife, she is already stressed and is leaning on me more for support. But fuck man, I didn't sign up for this when I started this job years ago. My job has been called many things ""unskilled, menial, hard labor"" but this is the first time has it been called essential. It still doesn't really feel that way either.

31,1585222422,Commander_PonyShep,The death rate is increasing while the recovery rate is decreasing,"So I check [this website](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) regularly, and I noticed how the death toll is dramatically increasing, while the recovery rate is decreasing.  And that worries me, and I don't have a reason as to why unless I ask you to explain it to me.

And also, I forgot to mention this in my first post on this subreddit, but my stepfather is 67 years old.  He's the oldest in our household, with my mother being in the middle, around her late fifties to early sixties, and myself being in my thirties.  That means that he's the most likely to die from the coronavirus, especially with his cancer and respiratory problems that he has right now, and that worries me even more than getting myself infected, since I'm most likely to survive it.  Same thing for my mother, just less likely because of her healthy lifestyle, but not by much herself, either.

Combine that with the dramatically increasing death rate versus the decreasing recovery rate, and you got yourself something more dire than it already needs to be, and one that could last for several months, maybe even longer than that.  So is there anything you guys can do to reassure me about the coronavirus and my stepfather being the most likely to die from it out of all three of us in the same household?  And can you provide that same reassurance regarding my actual father, who's around sixty-five to sixty-six himself, and heck, my *whole* *family*, in-general?",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fp9zmw/the_death_rate_is_increasing_while_the_recovery/

You know that feeling when you really struggle to get a good, full healthy breath of oxygen into your lungs? It’s been very consistent, but within that I am still able to catch good breath every once in a while. It’s gotten better during my sleep though. Doesn’t wake me up at night and I’ve not hyperventilated.

That being said, there’s also been strange pains in my torso. Now, if this was any normal time in the world I’d attribute it to a sore back as it feels a bit tight, but due to all this panic and scaremongering in the news, I’m always worried with every sensation I feel.

I haven’t experienced any other symptoms, fever, runny nose – I do cough sometimes from this tingle in my throat, but again, in any other time, I wouldn’t seek medical help for this cough as it’s not persistent. I might cough 5-6 times a day, who knows, maybe more, but it’s not the type of cough that would make someone think I have a “cough”.

I’m highly certain that this is anxiety, but knowing something is anxiety doesn’t really make it any better.

I’m 100% aware that my anxiety manifests itself in physical symptoms (my whole body gets welts and I shred the skin on my hands from scratching). When I was pregnant last year I convinced myself I had complications multiple times. I didn’t. I know that I do this- but my god I cannot shake this paralyzing fear that I’m sick with COVID19 and I’ve gotten my baby sick. 

My chest is tight and achy, I’ve had sinus pain, a stuffy nose and a headache for days. I feel foggy and shaky and have to try not to concentrate on my breathing or else I can’t take full breathes. My appetite is gone and there is a heavy pit in my stomach. I’m waking multiple times in the night with a racing heart. What if this time these aren't psychosomatic symptoms and I have the virus? Will I not be able to hold my baby for weeks? Did I infect her and now she is going to have breathing problems for life? I take our temperatures twice a day but I read of cases where a fever isn’t present for awhile and get worked up. 

There was just a confirmed case in my suburb tonight and I fear this won’t ever stop. Every time I hold my phone I obsessively look at the news, covidpositive, covid19_support, etc.

I try to talk to my husband and he is caring and loving- but he doesn’t understand anxiety. I just want to curl in a ball and cry- sometimes it’s hard to hold and kiss my baby because I’m so numb with fear. 

As much as I’ve always convinced myself these things aren’t a big deal and I’m normal- as I read this post back I realize how concerning it sounds. Sorry that this is rambly I just need some comfort...",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fpae3v/anxiety_support_needed/

When the year started I was definitely in a much better place however just before this all went to shit I can't say I was. At that time it was genuinely worse than it had been in a long time, life just kept on piling on, but I kept on going thinking that with time and effort things would get better, and then world got sick.

Before going on I just want to say that I consider myself very lucky in this case, I haven't lost my job and have been working from home for the past 2 weeks, I don't have to worry about money, food or rent at the moment. 

All of the issues that I was dealing with before are still present, just in a distant way. Being at home for two weeks has made everything feel distant, I feel static. Living the same day week after week with little variation and no end in sight; any progress I had made in life and all of my plans, one of which was finally moving out of my homophobic parents place, have been put on hold indefinitely. 

I never realised how I took for granted going out every day, even if its just going to work.

Depression is the devil I know, I know how to recognise it, I know how to deal with it and so when I can feel it coming on I immediately get to work, over the years I've come up with a five point system, a lot of the time when I'm feeling down and don't know why is due to either a lack of:

1. Good food
2. Water
3. Sleep
4. Exercise 
5. Sunlight/Fresh Air

Things which personally help me out a lot, and if they can help you then all the better for it. I try to not let myself get stagnant, spending days on end doing nothing but watching movies and YouTube, its easy to do so but I'm left worse off in the long run, instead I try to do something different, go for a run, bake, cook, take up one of my many abandoned hobbies and small projects, things I can feel proud of, things that have an easily achievable end result that I can look at and know that I did something, and its something to be proud of. 

All of that along side keeping up with my list of 5 and being strict with myself, making sure I eat and eat good food, making sure I keep moving and don't let myself stop, because when we stop we sink.

42,1585233017,erikrthecruel,My Experience," 

I drove out here out of an abundance of caution. Didn’t want to risk going straight home, not with dad’s age and health. We had a little get together before I left school. I wasn’t too worried about it- after all, no one there had it, and I was coming out here anyways. So, the plan was to spend a couple weeks out here alone in the boonies, long enough to be sure I wasn’t infected.

When I say out here, I really do mean out here. Woods or fields on three sides, an empty house on the fourth. An empty cabin in the woods. One store near enough, but they were sold out after the supply chains went to hell. Wifi sucked, phone signal was in and out.

At first, the only thing I minded was the loneliness. Had been a week without seeing another human face, which is never fun. I worked out like crazy, watched a ton of Netflix, smoked and drank way too much to kill the boredom. Took long walks in the winter woods, since spring hadn’t had time to make it out here yet and there was most of a foot of snow on the ground.

The economic news wasn’t great either. Any time economists use phrases like “Black Monday” three Mondays in a row you know you’re in deep shit. Unemployment claims for the first week came to almost three and a half million people. I still had a job after graduation, I hoped…anyways, that was my biggest worry.

At first, I put the cough down to the weed. The reason it was getting worse every day was that I was smoking every night. And of course it was a dry cough, it was because the smoke was irritating my throat. Made sense.

Then, when my throat started to hurt and my nose stuffed up, I put it down to allergies. Timing seemed about right. Gotta be allergies. Nothing to worry about. Same with when my eye swelled shut from conjunctivitis. And if the cough was deeper now, and I was starting to cough up thick green mucus, well, that could surely be allergies too, right?

I’ll be honest. There’s nothing quite like being driven to your knees from a coughing fit, and looking down to see your own blood splattered on the floor in front of you, to tell you that you probably aren’t dealing with allergies.

When my buddy tested positive, I knew that last meet up had been a mistake. Started reaching out to other friends who’d been exposed. One was sick, and her boyfriend had lost his sense of smell and taste. Another felt like he had a weight on his chest and a brutal cough. More were holed up at home in their rooms, terrified to come near their parents.

Talked to a doctor. Told me to stay out here unless I thought I was about to die. Something real eerie about that. Can’t shake the feeling that the world is ending. And to be honest, part of me worries a little that one of these nights I’ll realize I’m drowning in my own lungs and be too far gone to do anything about it.

Three of our most junior staff have been laid off, with the prospect of further cuts down the line if business slows down.

I cried a lot. Flipped out when I noticed my husband had closed the living room windows before I realized he was still at home. Not my most shining moment.

46,1585236224,BobSponge22,Coronavirus Thoughts,"Thanks to this whole ""social distancing"" trend, I don't think the world will ever be the same again. I think that we’ve overreacted to this virus so much, that the societal and political damage can never be undone. Even after the virus is gone in about a month, people will probably still be thinking ""I hope this guy doesn't have a virus"" whenever they're even 20 feet away from another person. Also, ""drastic measures"" are almost universally accepted now, and I find that extremely disturbing. I'm feeling sick to my stomach knowing that I'm one of very few people who aren't afraid of the virus and don't want any drastic or society-changing measures taken place. People don't even care about the economy anymore. They aren’t thinking about how millions of people could starve to death in a worldwide economic depression if these cancellations and quarantines aren’t lifted soon, not to mention how unhappy everyone will be during this virus and beyond. Even the term ""social distancing"" makes my bones chill! Just last February, I seriously thought I was already in the roaring 2020s. COVID-19 wasn't even affecting the economy until we were told that the virus can be spread through casual contact, and everyone believes that because scientists said so. The WHO can say that blinking causes cancer, and 99% of people would believe them just because they're scientists. I’m not saying that the WHO is evil and has a plan to destroy the American Dream, but that they were forced to come up with a solution fast. I can prove that this virus isn’t spread through casual contact, and I don’t need sources to do so, just scientific thinking. If people didn't start socially distancing until mid-March, and people who’ve had the virus weren't quarantined until two weeks after they got it (supposedly infecting people they've come in contact with during those two weeks), why did it take until now for the numbers to skyrocket everywhere else? You see, I think it’s just airborne, but I could be wrong (could be right too). Back in the Middle Ages, science was all about disproving stuff, but now, you either agree with everything the scientists say, or you're a ""conservatard redneck"". The American Dream is done for, and I find that very disheartening.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fpdcl5/coronavirus_thoughts/

The odds of you dying, no matter how old you are or how dire your pre-conditions, are much lower than you are currently afraid of. Bold statement, I know, let me explain: What people and scientists are referring to when talking about how many people succumb is the **C**ase **F**atality **R**ate (CFR). What does it mean? It measures the % of people out of the **tested and confirmed** infected who succumb. But this isn't an accurate reflection of how many infected actually die. Scientists have to use CFR as a reference because it's the only number that is for certain.

So, what gives us an actual representation of how many infected people actually die? It's called the **I**nfection **F**atality **R**ate (IFR). This includes not only the tested and confirmed, but also the symptomatic people who are not tested because they're not bad enough to have the very limited testing capacity used for them, but most importantly it includes the large amount of people without any symptoms at all, or just super slight ones like a loose stool, back pain, slightest sore throat etc, basically people who would never think that they're infected and therefor wouldn't get tested, unless they have a confirmed relative. But since community spread is now, sadly, the main driver of infections, you can't really ever be safe from not becoming infected as long as you come in contact with anyone, so there will be even less asymptomatic / low symptomatic cases being found. Of course the IFR will, by the nature of it, always be just an estimation. But with the limited testing capacity around the globe, we just won't know any better. But there are good ways to estimate the IFR rather precisely regardless.

So, we know that CFR is estimated to be at around 3.4% by the W.H.O, we know that it is much higher than that in Italy and Spain. But what about IFR?

I have an excellent report here by the highly reputable [Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Evidence-Based_Medicine) which covers exactly this: [https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/) (scroll further down to the 26. March updates)

Important Quote:

&gt;Our current best assumption, as of the 22nd March, is the IFR is approximate 0.20% (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.25)

I don't want to make this post much longer than it has to be, so please visit the link and read for yourself how they come to this conclusion.

Further evidence for a much lower IFR:

Germany, my hood! We have as of writing this (according to [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries)) relatively close to as many confirmed cases as Spain, but they have 20x (!) as many casualties. I know: Beer, Sauerkraut and Leberkäse makes us strong. In all seriousness though, the Virus doesn't care about your birthplace, it's impossible that Spain would have that many more casualties if their infection count would be accurate if you compare them to Germany. What you can conclude here is that Spain (as well as any other country with a oddly high CFR, like Italy) just hasn't identified nearly as many of their infected people as Germany has. And yes, even Germany will have a not so insignificant amount of people still undiagnosed, simply because so many people are asymptomatic or have only super slight, barely noticeable symptoms.

So yeah, the Pandemic is a catastrophe and we must do EVERYTHING we can to slow it down, but it is not going to kill you as likely as you might have had the impression of.

**TLDR:** CFR does not reflect the actual % of infected who succumb. IFR, so all infected not just the confirmed ones, is estimated only to a fraction of the CFR.

March update)](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/) for reference.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fpew1l/common_misconceptions_about_how_deadly_this_virus/

49,1585244968,tootsdafroots,I feel like I'm imploding,"I know that this isn't an easy time for anyone, and everyone is facing their own set of unique personal challenges right now.

But wow. I am spectacularly unable to cope anymore. I'm normally a positive person who tries to make the most out of every situation, in fact, a situation like this would be the ideal thing for me to use to my advantage, but it hasn't gone that way at all I'm afraid.

It's a whole series of cascading issues that have just brought me to my knees in the past few days.

I'm 24 and I've been staying at my parent's house in the US for three months now while I wait for my UK spouse visa. I haven't seen my husband for that amount of time. I was literally supposed to be receiving my papers this week but instead, all of my documents were dumped on my doorstep sans visa, with notice that processing will resume when New York offices reopen.

My husband and I have been trying to sort out a game-plan for this for several weeks now. What we plan on doing during this global crisis, how we plan on getting back together if that's our primary goal, etc. Up until this point, it was our primary goal, I kept checking in with him to make sure that was the case - we were going to do whatever we can to be together... that was possibly going to mean him having to travel to me - he agreed that he would if that was going to be our last option. I've since done everything that I could to make this work.

Now. I no longer have the option to travel. As my visa is still 'pending', attempting to enter the UK would void my application which has cost us over 6k and three months of my life. I would also likely have trouble at customs because of the fact that I have a long-term visa pending, they would be suspicious that I was trying to stay, which is terms for sending me on the next flight out of there.

Upon this disappointing news my husband said that he couldn't come to me, because it would interfere with his work schedule too much as he would have to wake up too early. I thought this was a crappy reason to go back on his *promise* that we would both do *whatever we can* to get to each other, and he in turn felt like I was belittling his situation and didn't understand how hard work was for him. He had just escaped the city to his parents house and it turns out that he never even considered bringing his passport with him and therefore never intended to follow through on his side of this agreement or even *pretend to.* Our flat is 9 hours from his parents' house... he's not getting it. It's not happening.

I'm devastated. The disappointment of the visa news was huge. Being apart for three months has already been hard. When the global pandemic became a likelihood we spoke seriously about the importance of being together through this because the stress of being separate was already enough. On top of fearing for my health on my family I wake up every single day and go to bed every single night with the void of not being together, and being so far away.

I was trying to go at this proactively before, exercising, spending more time outside, getting personal projects done, but I've suddenly just lost all will to do anything at all.

I have no appetite, I can't finish a meal without feeling intensely nauseous. I really haven't been able to eat at all in three days. Nothing feels like it means anything anymore. I can't sleep at night, when I do finally fall asleep I have horrendous, vivid nightmares, like of my whole family being murdered in front of me or my body being split in two. I can't sleep solidly through the night and wake up from these dreams with horrible emotional and physical pain and wind up sobbing as I've never sobbed in my entire life. I have no faith in the integrity of what my husband says - his act of even forgetting his passport makes me feel like he doesn't give a single damn. That being together though this isn't possible anymore because his having to wake up early is too inconvenient for him even though the measures that I was going to have to take to get on that plane to go to him were much more drastic.

I'm going through bouts of horrible, intense sadness, and then finally reaching the bottom of that emotional well, where I don't find relief, I just find totally and utter emptiness.

I just don't care about anything anymore. I'm not suicidal but I do wish that I could just disappear, or cease to exist.

This whole thing is so scary and huge and that coupled with the disappointment and fear of being apart from my husband is just too much... it's all just too much.

I'm disappointed with myself for reaching this low... I didn't think that I was capable of it... it isn't in my character. I feel broken.

I've been through some other very touch situations but I feel that, at the level of despair that I'm experiencing now, I don't think that my body or my mind can handle this that much longer... and if I do get sick..

55,1585256267,missme33321,75 year old grandpa still working - hard to get through to him,"Hi all, I have been struggling lately due to being anxious and emotionally drained. My grandparents raised me so they are really my parents. For this reason, I've been obviously very concerned for them during this time and have felt a huge responsibility to ensure their safety. 

Both were very hard to get through to about the seriousness of coronavirus and the importance of staying home. Both thrive off of socializing outside the house. It took many conversations for me to get through to them. Thankfully, my grandma's job asked her to stay home and she finally is fine staying home all the time for now. My grandpa is also staying home, but he still is working and this is my last remaining concern for them.

He works in an auto repair shop three days a week. Three additional days of the week he mows lawns for people for additional income. Please note my grandparents are pretty low income and completely not working is not an option for them. I would help if I could but I also have no income as I am in graduate school.

The good thing about the auto job is that he works by delivering car parts and they currently are doing contactless delivery. I am still worried because he enters the store between every delivery he makes. My grandpa is very stubborn and though he says he uses gloves and hand sanitizers at work, I am doubtful. Me and my grandma have talked to him many times but he often says we don't need to worry and he won't get the virus. He does not believe he is at much of a risk so therefore it is unlikely  he takes every precaution he can. 

As far as mowing yards,  my only concern for this is when customers hand him money, as well as the fact that he is still going to the bank to make deposits (he does not and will not use an ATM). I told my grandma this morning that I think it would be best if I come by every week and he leaves the money in the mailbox and I got deposit it for him. However, she was resistant to this. 

I have no idea if my grandpa's employer would let him stay home for a bit and continue to pay him but I think it is worth asking. I am planning on calling my grandpa tonight and talking to him more about discussing this with his boss as well as allowing me to go to the bank for him.

I cry every day because I feel so out of control. My grandparents mean everything to me and they made me who I am. I feel so much responsibility for them and that's why I try so hard to keep them safe. It's scary because I know my grandpa will continue to not want to listen and I also know if he does stay home more it will take a toll on his mental health.

57,1585258822,guaip,My wife is pregnant and due next week. What now?,"She's almost 39 weeks and is due next week. We're in Brazil, where as March 23 we had 2,550 cases and 123 in our town. It's already considered a nationwide community transmission and we are climbing the ""transmission wall"" right now. Our hospital had a few cases (5 confirmed, 1 in the ICU), but it's in a different building. And quarantine protocols have been in place weeks before the first case.

I've been a bit nervous about getting it because if I do it would probably mean I cannot be with her in the labor room, and even do my share of caring the baby in the first few weeks.

I know all statistics work on our favour (we're on our 30s and my town have just a few cases compared to the major European cities), and symptoms on newborns seems to be mild, but there are exceptions. I try to have a positive attitude towards this situation, but when I tell someone she's due next week, their response is always ""oh, that sucks"".

But we're doing our share to be safe. I already worked from home and she is in her leave since March 1st. I only left our house to go to the supermarket once and to a couple of appointments with her doctor. I wash my hands paranoically and make her do it too.

Anyone else facing the same situation? I know chances are everything is going to be fine for us, but having a ching should be only joy combined with the common worries of the subjetc. Adding a fast-spreading-virus in the equation is keeping a part of my brain thinking about it ALL. THE. TIME.

60,1585261249,Reflectivecoat,Long distance relationship turn to short distance stay at home blow up.,"I have met someone I truly love. Someone with a strength of character that I can not help but admire. We met a long time ago working together on the same job, starting dating three years ago, and moved in together soon after. We both travel for our jobs. We tend to be home together a few times a month and extended periods on end of year holidays. 

Two weeks ago our job sent everyone home. It was a scary and hectic few days. I had to fly home and start the Costco/grocery store runs. She had to spend a three day drive coming home from work and picking up her kids to stay and hunker down with us. 

Our relationship has been difficult already even though the love is there. I have never been in a relationship for this long and this far away from home before. She has two wonderful kids that are pretty grown and went through divorce five years before coming into my life. Sometimes I feel like everything I say and do is wrong. I think she feels either unappreciated or ignored. It gets worse when we are relaxed like over the holidays. Communication slowly breaks down and yelling starts. We started seeing a couples' councilor around 6 months ago.

This is very new for the both of us. We never had to work at home before. Like a 9 to 5 monday - friday see each other everyday situation. The kids are here also. The work is wildly different and stressful because of the changes. It's become a very rocky career adjustment over the past two weeks. Me personally I very much miss working away from home even though I love being with my family. It feels different having to work and home life when our job truly expects the same level of commitment.

We all are in truly unprecedented situation. Worldwide no one knows what the future may hold. I feel that it's not incredibly difficult for me separate fact from fiction. I live in a progressive state (in the USA) that acted quickly and protects it's people and doesn't have the density of states in true crisis. When we sneak out to do grocery runs for fresh food things are different but civilization has not crumbled. It can get bad here just like anywhere but we are safe. 

Relationships are hard and take a lot of work. I'm very happy. I have home and family and car and a really cute dog named Doughnut. Things are really scary right now and me and girlfriend had a very bad blow up over pancakes this morning. I have a backlog of books and video games just sitting around for prompt consumption. I feel like every thing I say to my girlfriend is one step away from potentially hurting her. I want things to go back to normal but I understand things will never truly be normal ever again. We're forced to attempt to work and live together in a way we never had to before and I'm failing at making things better.  I've suffered from depression and anxiety before and have learned ways to manage it.

Now I'm afraid of what happens if we do break up.  What if things do break down and I have to leave the house I live in that is in her name.  I'm healthy and have a job but what if I have to move in a pandemic.  I want to make this work not because things are scary outside but because I love her.

One of my biggest fears is a tooth infection (which I've been fighting off and on since November - currently in the middle of a multi-stage root canal to treat it), another is anything that causes fevers, and while I prefer being at home I get MASSIVELY triggered when I'm ""trapped"" in my house because of past abusive experiences.

And honestly, I was doing bad enough with just the tooth infection and some other issues that I very nearly went inpatient for my mental issues back in December. Ugh.

So, I've not been...doing great.  


I live on Long Island. I've been trying to keep it together. Me, my girlfriend, and my best friend are all isolating together as much as possible. I work from home, and both their jobs are having them not work right now. I've been proud of how I've been handling it - I've been playing Animal Crossing, trying to monitor how often I look up news, and trying to end each round of news browsing with this sub and other positive places. I've not been okay, but I've been....surviving. Coping. Eating more than I expected, which is good. Not in a continual full-on panic attack all day at least.  


I've been so scared of the surge hitting the hospitals though. I got so sad yesterday because I couldn't stop thinking about how many people may die in NYC if the hospitals are overcrowded, even if social distancing works perfectly (the people who were already infected). I kept imagining the scenarios in Italy, which were breaking my heart. And just .... knowing it was coming in NYC and I couldn't do anything...it was breaking me. And I feel so terrible for the doctors. I just...I can't.  


And I feel so selfish. Because I also have a massive phobia of being far away from hospitals or even from a good hospital - even though I'm terrified of hospitals and doctors. (I'm tense all the time, if I think about it, because my local hospital isn't great. And I get TERRIFIED camping or vacationing anywhere that's far from a hospital. Like I'm edgy the whole time.) And now, with how overcrowded the hospitals are or may be, I feel like hospitals just like...don't exist. I feel like everywhere is a remote camping site and I'm not safe no matter where I go. So I've been really selfishly scared, on top of everything else, that I'll either catch this during the peak and not get treated, or another emergency will happen and I won't get treated. And then I feel guilty for being afraid of that, because other people are dying and doctors are working so intensely.  


I'd been trying to calm myself by reassuring myself that Long Island isn't as dense as NYC (at least not out east, where I am). But I got terrified tonight and tried to look up how busy our hospitals are, and it looks like they're getting hit hard too (though I have no clue if they are overrun or if it is manageable). But one has like tents outside, but I'm trying to think that's probably a good thing, that maybe they're preparing and they arent' overrun at the moment. Maybe they won't be. Maybe we've slowed it enough. But I just...don't know.  


So now I'm just...petrified. Like it feels like so close to a breaking point. And of course it's making me feel sick. And I'm terrified of eating anything that doesn't seem ""safe"" in case I get food poisoning. I'm terrified of getting sick. I'm terrified of getting hurt. I'm terrified of falling apart and needing to go inpatient and catching it in a hospital, and either catching it here, or not being able to get treated, or like....taking time away from patients that need them more.  


I'm just so, so scared. And I feel so selfish for being scared about this part. I'm not high-risk (knock on wood, though I don't do well with chest stuff as a rule since I had bronchitis, but I think that's okay? Again, massive knock on wood). Me and my closest people get to be home. I'm not home alone. I'm not a doctor. I shouldn't be complaining. I shouldn't be scared. I shouldn't be so self-centered. I KNOW I'm being ridiculous. (I even, knock on wood, think there's a chance I had this in January. But then I still get afraid something ELSE will happen to me. Ugh.)

70,1585269494,enelysionheart,My little nephew has tested COVID-19+,"My nephew Gabe, I have seen him grow up from the time he was a baby. He was different from the time he was little, and grew up a little odd. I guessed early on that he might be somewhere on the autism spectrum, and I was right, I am sad to say. I'm not sad he's special, I just hate for him to have to deal with the struggles that come with it. He has grown up into a wonderful young man of 16 years. I was away from him for about ten years when I had to go do 9 years for a non violent first offense drug bust, 10grams of LSD, and in the time between we had been separated because I could not get in touch with his mother.

I went down to visit his family during my father's recent death, and it was so beautiful to reconnect with him. He is smart as a whip, and loves transformers, pokemon, and anime. We get along famously, and have been in touch over facebook since I have been able, to support to encourage him.

About as soon as I was through being homeless in Feb, this whole COVID-19 thing started. First it was in china, then it was in Italy, then it was in the internet, in the news, in America, then no ramen soups or TP, lockdowns, and now my poor little nephew is sick with the creeping crud!

I wish he was asymptomatic, but he is showing signs of infection and got a test after being exposed to some family from Florida that had it. He tested positive, and now he's eating pudding to help with his throat. I am keeping in touch and am doing everything I can to get people to pray for him during this troubled time for our great nation. Would you? Even a brief nod would do wonders with the heart of God, I am sure. Thank you in advance.

Gabriel is a good dude, and he makes me proud. If anyone wants to pray for him, or suggest some cool stuff for him to check out while he is quarantined down in KY that would be awesome. I'm stressed out, but don't worry about me, I'll be fine. Thanks for being there for me, internet. You better believe you are in my heart, and in my mind.

But they also had a hungry family and their own ingenuity. Most of our comfort foods and most famous cuisines came from one brave person somewhere back in time, taking a desperate situation and turning it into something comforting and worthy of being passed down through generations!

Our lives suddenly seem wildly disconnected—I’m safely self-isolating and working remotely while he’s waiting to get sick because proper infection control is impossible when he is rationing PPE. The anxiety I have about finishing up my master’s thesis pales in comparison to the shit he’s experiencing.

He tries to hide it, but I can see the toll it’s taking when we FaceTime. I‘m beyond afraid and concerned for both his physical and mental health. I can tell he is stressed and anxious and distraught. I can tell he is even more overworked and burnt out. I can tell he is bottling in stories, thoughts, and emotions he would otherwise share.

The pandemic surge is only going to get worse, and I worry about how this may traumatize him? I worry he’ll ignore his own needs and hyper-focus on patients.

I hate that I’m not physically there for him. I hate that I’m limited in the ways I can comfort him. He is a wonderful, considerate person and a dedicated MD. He deserves so much more.

How do I navigate this? How do I help him? Can I help him? How do I be strong for him? How do I stay strong? I feel so lost and overwhelmed.

I’m already crying after we FaceTime sometimes because of what little he‘ll share with me. And I’m filled with so much shame and guilt because he is the one in the ER, not me. It’s taking a toll on him, not me. It’s him carrying that burden, not me.

79,1585278864,rraak,How do I cope with all the hassle of staying healthy when my main reasons for trying are gone?,"I'm not a young guy, I've loved a lot and I've lost a lot. I lost the biggest in my entire life tonight and, while I'm actually quite calm and maybe a little numb, my future no longer really has any interest. I've been through a lot in my life, and meeting her was so wonderful and beautiful, we just clicked... And now it's ended, and my hopes for the future went with it. All my interests and motivations. Too many eggs in the basket I suppose. But there they went. 

I've seen it coming for a few weeks. My fiancee had an extremely traumatic year with the loss of a very close family member and, in her own words, is utterly broken. Little hints here and there, some strange shyness around me the other week, and lots of talk of having to go it alone through this ordeal. She ultimately wants to make major changes in her life and, prior to recently, or maybe tonight? Always seemed to plan to want me to go with. Due to my health potentially causing severe complications if I get sick, we decided to stay apart during the quarantine. Now I'll probably not see her again at all in happy times. 

Tonight we broke up. She seemed to be looking for an opening and took it the first time I said something controversial. I guess it was easier for her to have something to get angry about. Yesterday I came very close to posting in this forum about how hard it was to be away from her, and from her dogs (who adopted me as their own daddy). The whole pack got me through the loss of my own beautiful dog a year ago... And now they're gone to me too.

I guess I'm already a casualty of COVID19. I can't help but feel indifferent at this point about whether I get it or whether it takes me. My future ended tonight and I'm old enough that I don't have the heart or the interest in picking up the pieces and trying to move on again.

At the end of the day, I just don't understand why anyone would want to throw away such a close relationship over literally nothing, over text of all things. We were such close friends, and her family was wonderful to me, and more than than anything I suppose I fear for her.

I remember the last time I physically saw a friend – 9th March 2020 – 

Haven’t seen you since, but you still exist. And what great efforts we are making to prove and improve our connection to each other – not just with you – I just remember the last time I hugged you. 

Between then and now is a hazy amalgam of CAR-SHOPPING CART-GLOVES-PUT YOUR GLOVES ON-MASK-WAIT, MASKS ACTUALLY DON’T WORK-WHAT?-IM COUGHING DOES THAT MEAN- nah you’re alright, no fever, it’s all good, right?

When did this all happen?

What a beautiful thing it is to be so collectively distraught, confused, but open about it. And going to great lengths at that, to talk about it, to comfort each other; to grieve together. 

In the peaceful before times, I’d go days without hearing a friend’s voice, sometimes even not answering their phone calls, pretending I wasn’t there. I’m sorry I never fully knew how close we actually were. But how do you appreciate something and not take it for granted when you know its presence is guaranteed? Evidently, it’s not guaranteed.

In this time of social distancing, yes, we are physically apart from people we’d like to hug and kiss, but it’s evident we are substituting physical closeness with something else. Perhaps not exactly emotional closeness, but there’s a collective “something” in the air.

For better or worse, I think better, that collective something seems to be grief. Grieving the loss of normalcy, the loss of connection, anticipating the worst case scenarios (Berinato, 2020). Through all this though, we’re supporting each other through each stage – denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. We may each be in separate stages at any given time, waking up hopeful one day, and depressed the next, or shifting daily; hourly, even. 

There are no solutions to this situation, but it’s comforting and incredible to know that simply talking about your feelings makes a big difference. We learnt in school that when you multiply two negatives, you get a positive. There’s no question that we’ve all been negatively affected by this, but I know you’d probably be lying if you haven’t extracted some deeply positive feelings at some point; about your loved ones, that street cat that has no idea what’s going on, noticing the boiler on the roof of the building across from you, making a puzzle, sleeping in.

We’re always a conversation away from feeling even the slightest bit better.

I wonder how long we’ll all hug for when this is all over.

97,1585300351,burrahobbits,The most depressed and anxious I have been in years,"Trigger warning// panic attacks, suicidal thoughts 

I am on my 17th day of being at home, originally did self isolation which then turned into a mandatory stay at home order. Since March 10th I haven't been able to see my therapist or go to my support group. I was supposed to see my psychiatrist but then couldn't so my meds haven't changed in months and I really needed to adjust my meds because the effectiveness has greatly diminished. So basically I am the most depressed I have been in years and my anxiety is out of control to the point where I have had multiple panic attacks over these 2+ weeks. I feel nothing but yet at the same time feel everything from being sad, scared, alone, worried, helpless, angry, afraid, etc. I can't fill my time with hobbies and activities because I feel so drained and anxious, like I can't enjoy things anymore. I felt like I could barely function in daily life when there wasn't a pandemic going on and now that everything is falling apart I feel even more dysfunctional. This has put me back months on my progress I have made dealing with my mental issues. I feel as bad as I did when I had to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital a few years back. Everything just feels so bad. I feel like I am falling into a dark pit and can't escape. My suicidal ideation is non stop. I don't really want to kill myself because my biggest fear is the unknown after you die (hell, nothingness, etc.). My fear basically keeps me alive. But even still I keep saying ""why don't you just kill yourself"" and other bad things to myself. I think I still think these things not because I actually want to go through with ending my life but because I want all the pain to go away so badly.

100,1585305989,hermesthehedgie,Stressed for days,"Hello everyone! I am extremely glad I found this Reddit. I was one of those people not taking this seriously at first...but boy did that change.

I have really bad anxiety and paranoia. Last weds, March 18th, late at night at my girlfriends house I got this extreme pain in my stomach and had really bad diarrhea to where I couldn’t breath. I freaked out. Diarrhea is pretty common for me though, I have stomach issues (never been diagnosed, but I get diarrhea often). But then the fear set in, I HAVE COVID-19! Why was I struggling to breath. Since then, every day I’ve been so stressed. Every day since then my stomach has been hurting. It’s a dull pain. My stomach is constantly gurgling. I’ve been constipated up until today March 26th (8 days later). It wasn’t diarrhea but it was still pretty soft. My stomach still just has that bloated, dull pain, and I’ll get an occasional dull pain in my chest. Later, I started getting constipated again. I keep worrying myself. I see articles and start to get hot with stress. Is this stomach issue Covid-19, or is my stress making me sick?

On top of that, I got pretty sick at the very beginning of February and have had a dry cough every day since then. So even though I’ve had it for that long, I still think it’s Covid. I thought, maybe it’s acid reflux? I get a dry cough after I eat, so it’s not a constant cough. I also seem to struggle breathing through my nose, not to where I need to go to the hospital.

The problem is...these are things I’ve had before. I have bad stomach issues before (it’s an on running joke that everything I eat just goes right through me). I’ve had this cough for over a month. My breathing issues, I’ve always kinda struggled with breathing out of my nose and I snore really bad (I’m 31 and overweight but not drastically, 198lbs, 6ft make).

I’m so scared. I’m almost always fighting with myself to get a hang on things. Set my mind straight, but then I hear the news or my stomach starts to hurt again and I start stressing out. It’s not extreme pain. Just dull. I stopped going out on the 18th and haven’t been anywhere since. I was an Uber and Lyft driver (Bakersfield, Ca) and picked up strangers for weeks up until I decided not to on the 18th. 

Am I just paranoid? Are these symptoms my usual and now they just seem escalated because of my worries? I live with my parents as I help my mom take care of my 88 year old dad, they’ve shown no symptoms, my girlfriend who comes here (who doesn’t go anywhere else) has shown no symptoms, but I know it can just sneak up on you. 

This is very scary. I’m so worried and paranoid. I just can’t keep myself straight.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fpuu5h/stressed_for_days/

So I usually get my daughter on weekends. For the past two weeks, this hasn't been possible due to my countries health and government officials heavily advising not to travel. I would need to get two trains and a bus to get to her, and the same on the way back with her, which usually isn't an issue at all but given the current circumstances I just feel like it would be highly irresponsible to do that, as a parent and as someone actively trying to prevent the spread of this virus.

I work in a massive UK supermarket almost every day due to the lack of staff we currently have, and as such at a much higher risk of getting the virus than a lot of people, I just feel like that on top of that much public transportation would be putting too many people at risk.

The decision to not go and get my daughter due to this has been entirely my own, I'm not being prevented. I just feel like such an asshole for not doing it. I would love nothing more than to have her with me right now. I know this isn't anywhere near as bad as some peoples situations, and people are losing their lives. 

I just want all of this to be over and for everyone to be safe.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fpuu9k/not_able_to_see_my_daughter_due_to_the_pandemic/
102,1585308626,Rootbeer_Float,"With so many of our lives changing suddenly, I'd like to bring attention to the feeling of depersonalization.","[Depersonalization](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depersonalization-derealization-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352911) is a feeling of detachment. You may have experienced it in an overwhelming, unfamiliar situation or while intoxicated. It's the third most common mental health symptom after depression and anxiety. 

It's also thought to be a symptom of anxiety and a self defence mechanism of the mind to protect the individual from trauma, such as a car crash or childhood abuse. Many reported the world around them feeling unreal after 9/11 happened.

You may currently feel the world around you is dreamlike/unreal. You may suddenly feel like you're an outside observer of your body and its actions. You feel numb as the world around you changes instantly.

If you feel this way, please don't panic. It means you're obviously stressed, rightfully so, and your mind is trying to protect you as it tries to deal with the situation objectively. Reach out for professional help, even if it's done remotely. Find something, just one thing, that relaxes you and helps clear your mind like working out or journaling. 

Stay safe and keep busy.

On a similar note and for those curious: Depersonalization Disorder is a loss of self/identity with a constant feeling of depersonalization and derealization. Many of us are losing what used to be a part of our identity, such as our jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's three things that happened here:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The first patient in the city of Mostar came back from skiing in Italy and developed symptoms. He was admitted to the hospital by a family member without following the proper procedure. He got admitted to the LUNG DEPARTMENT, while having a high fever and coughing. A lot of doctors and nurses had to go into self isolation and one nurse tested positive. The patient kept denying that he went to Italy. Last I heard all cases in the city are related to this one.

&amp;#x200B;

\-A party of 200 people was held by politicians and businessmen to celebrate the 30  year (I, think) anniversary of a company. One of them was infected and spread it further. All cases in the city of Konjic are related to this party. The driver of the infected person has died. This was held after measures were already implemented. Schools were closed, people were told to stay home and work from home. Gatherings of no more than 10 people, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\-This morning two people (mother and son) who were tested positive escaped from the infectious disease ward in the city of Banja Luka. They were moved there after they complained at the conditions of the student housing they were placed in, and the son treated to jump from the fifth floor. The police are currently looking for them.

105,1585310843,Streetwearthrow,Mental health going downhill fast," 

I wasn't exactly in a great spot mentally before this  crisis really started but I was feeling hopeful, I was doing better than  I had been in the past, and had plans to find an apartment with my  boyfriend in the near future. Now it just feels like it's all down the  drain. I knew that this sort of stuff would be difficult but I didn't  know it'd be this bad. Between the lack of any social interaction or a  routine and the anxiety and hopelessness about the pandemic, it's  scaring me how fast I'm becoming non functional. I'm hardly ever out of  bed as I use sleep as an escape, and when I am it's probably to eat  shitty food, go to the bathroom, or to smoke enough weed that I can go  back to sleep (yes I know it's a terrible idea to be smoking at the  moment but I don't think I could cope if I had to be sober). Waking up  usually involves crying until I'm too tired to keep crying. I feel  hopeless, it's only been two weeks but I already can't see any sort of  normal life emerging from this. Am I going to be wearing gloves to touch  the grocery cart handles for the rest of my life? If he survives, will  it ever be safe for me to visit my immunocompromised grandfather? Will I  ever be comfortable going to restaurants again? Me and my boyfriend had  tickets to see RATM in July, and the notion of a gathering like that  happening then, or ever again, just seems laughable. I get that my  concerns are pretty trivial compared to some of the shit healthcare  workers or immunocompromised people have to worry about. I'm just  worried that if heavy self isolation and social distancing like this  keeps up for the next few months as I know it has to, I'm not going to  be able to keep myself going through it. It's barely been two weeks and  I'm cracking, so what does 4 or 5 months look like? ",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fpvt6y/mental_health_going_downhill_fast/

The whole thing lasted for almost two weeks, I got a temperature of 100 again yesterday, but also a cold sore, so maybe that's where that came from.

Anyway, the reason I'm questioning the accuracy of the test is that the paramedic that came to test me did the following:

swabbed my one nostril for 2 or three seconds, no twisting or anything as far as I could see, didn't feel it at all besides some tickling - I'm not sure he even reached the back of my throat. Then did a cheek swab like they do with DNA sampled. He then placed the swabs on my dresser before putting it in the thingy. Also, they came after I had had symptoms for 12 days already, would there still be enough viral trace in my body to catch it? (especially the way they did it)

Does anyone know if this could somehow compromise the test result? Or was what he did alright?

In my current situation I feel that my family is in a good place, my wife stays and works from home, our son who is 14 is home schooled and enjoys being at home (he misses his time at the library with his geeky friends but they are making it work through Discord and the lot) and my mother in law lives upstairs and doesn't leave the house much either, they are safe in my eyes and I couldn't be happier for the situation. And then there is ""me"", I'm the bread winner of the house, I'm also the only driver, grocery getter, errand runner, etc. I am the one out in the world now, and I never had a problem with my role in this, but now in the world that we live in I am just....terrified of bringing something home to those I care about most. My wife and my mother in law are Diabetic and since 2016 our lives have been one tragic event every year. 2016 we lost a child, stillborn, 2017 the trauma of that stillbirth caused medical issues for my Wife and we were in and out of the hospital all year, 2018 I got demoted from my job. These cascading event have really crushed me and mine, I was never an anxious person but now I always worry about ""What's going to happen now?"" Come 2020 things start looking better, I get my old job back, during my time in my less paying job I turned by passion for art into a side hustle that I really love. Things were going really great, the BOOM this shit happens.

I have always been the ""dirty"" one of my wife and I, I don't really get sick, I mean I wash my hands and I'm sanitary but I never put thought into just being ""clean"" all the time. My wife is a clean freak, always reminding me to wash my hands and sanitize, cuz when I DO get sick, I give it to her and she takes getting sick worst then I do. So in our 16 years together I have improved my cleanliness for her. But now that this shit is going on I am so fucking paranoid about being sick. I'm washing my hands more than I ever have in my life, I don't touch my face ever when I am out in the world and I'm the only one going out to make a paycheck and keep us stocked with supplies when needed. And I keep running lines in my head of ""Don't fuck up, don't fuck up, take this seriously, you're gonna fuck this up, cuz you don't try hard enough, you might be fine but the love of your life is gonna get it and shes gonna be BACK in the hospital fighting for her life again, your Son is going to lose his Mother AND Grandmother because you fucking can't just BE FUCKING CLEAN STOP FUCKING UP!"" Over and over and over. I'm at work just like ""Stay away from people, wash your hands, is that cough a sign?, wash your hands, am I hot? Is it hot? WASH YOUR FUCKING HANDS cuz if they get is sick it's YOUR FAULT""

Do you know that feeling when you're heart broken? It is a hard feeling to describe for those who don't know what it feels like. Being heartbroken is like having something pulled out from your very being. It's like someone is yanking on the strings of your heart and you feel this sharp pain like something is missing but you're at a lost for what it is. It's like eating a McDonalds happy meal but there is nothing happy about it, in fact it is the worst meal you could ever have.

The sad part is, while I'm wishing for the best, I know that the worst is just right around the corner staring me down while I can only pray and hope that he survives through this.

\*sorry if story is patchy, I really need some support right now and I'm really fragmented\*

TLDR: Dad is super sick, I get sad whenever I think about him.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fq3pul/please_help_me/

126,1585340647,hoppingwilde,I can feel myself slipping I to the dark...,"Iv been in quirintene for 3 weeks yesterday. I had chemo in December so to go to work is dangerous. My state hasnt been hit that hard abd while one of my doctor's think im freaking out the other 2 think im being safe. So iv decided to take this time in isolation to work on myself, aka work off my antidepressants. And started online therapy. 

But today all i could think about was killing myself. Watching my life savings be so little when I need it. My plans for the year be evaporated. How little people notice me being gone. I always m didnt like people but now that im away its less stressfull but obviously it must be having its toll. Also today i was looking my checking account fall and was thinking i need to go back to work and my first two thoughts were, i cant and its dangerous. And thats where the slipping started.  My normal defenses started of ""my mom couldn't handle it"" but that will only hold so long. Therapy just feels like in filling out worksheets and not helping. I fear that to go back on antidepressants will cement my dependency on them 

I have dealt with this for years, im only 25 but still. I know others have it worse. That im still healthy and its all in my head but i had to get it out there. Im scared. I have no money but more isolation to go. The idea of ending it will only get more and more appealing and the idea that no one will notice or care sounds more and more likely. Im sure this will just fade into the black, but that feels fitting right now.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fq4wj3/i_can_feel_myself_slipping_i_to_the_dark/

Are we able to be still seeing each other or is that extremely ill advised?,"My girlfriend is not in direct contact with COVID patients, and is seldom in contact with patients at all now, but does work in a COVID building. I have been working from home and have sheltered-in-place for over 2 weeks, only leaving very sparingly to get groceries or pick up food. 

Up to this point, we've been still hanging out at my place a majority of the nights. She has severe sleep anxiety and when she's not with me, is really struggling to sleep with all that is going on right now. Plus, her roommates are loud and stay up late. 

My roommate, unfortunately, is still continuing to go home to see his family and hang out there every so often. He's alternating being at the apartment and going home just to ""mix things up"" IE not get bored. 

I feel kind of overwhelmed with what we all should be doing here. Personally, I understand that I am at a higher risk myself by seeing her, but I am willing to take that risk. I do not want to ban her from coming here. I especially do not want to ban her from coming here so my roommate can continue to go home.

First of all, I wanna send my love to everyone suffering right now because of this; either people who got infected, people who have a loved one infected or to the people who are afraid or anxious about that.


I feel a little gulity worrying about what I worry about, since there are people who's physical helath has been hit. I tried to talk to some friends of mine, but they started the ""others have it worse now"", so I stopped. But I really need to get it out of my system, to rant about this without sounding like a jerk or something. The whole coronavirus has really fucked me up. I feel so scared and angry with the whole virus issue in the world and in my country (Greece). We do not have many cases (comparing to other european countries, like Italy), but things are evolving so quickly. Greece was already experiencing the economic crisis and now this. Everything is shut down and I am so afraid.  I try not to read a lot of news, but it is nearly impossible not to hear about it.


I have history with mental health problems and I feel like relapsing. The thought in my head are like a pile and it keep getting bigger. How many people will die? Should I be afraid? Maybe say goobdye to my grandparents? What if I die? Although I do not get out of the house (only to go to the supermarket), I feel afraid. What if I get infected there? What will my mother do? She has already lost a child, her husband, her father. She is not going to be ok. I do not want her to be sad. Constant fear and thoughts. I feel like I am drowning in those thoughts and feeling. My boyfriend and I were supposed to work in a hotel during the summer. Now this seems very unlikely. These money we both would earn, would be our safety mony until we find a job in the winter. What will I do for money? We won't have any money left in two, maybe three, months. After that we won't have money for the basic things. I cry all day, thinking that I might be homeless, that I might not be able to afford food, medicines. I do not want to take money from my mom.

I started quarantine on friday 13th and to this day I've only left the apartement once to stock up on food and snacks. But she is going out almost every day. She now works from home but she told me she gets side money from driving our neighbour (F) to get groceries.

I understand that she wants another source of income as her office job doesn't pay well (on top of that we're from Venezuela, to get you guys on social context), and my job got suspended as I work in the entertaiment field, the business decided to help the employees so I'm still getting paid some money and have a little bit saved up.

What troubles me is her, going out almost every day with our neigbour. Why doesn't she (my neigbour) makes one big purchase a week instead of doing it daily? Putting my mom at risk with her, as well as me.

My mom tries to explain herself, telling me she uses the mask and carries and uses her alcohol gel and that they don't get into crowded spaces; but that doesn't stop me from worrying and I discovered i'm kinda hypochondriac as I have to mantain myself distracted, because just taking a glance at news about the virus triggers a big worry and sometimes start getting a headache if I get too worried, or a discomfort in my throat like getting the flu. One day I got what I think it was a panic attack because suddenly my heart started beating really fast and my breathing got heavy,but that only lasted like 5 seconds until it went away and hasn't happened again.

I’ve been working from home since last Tuesday. I have gone grocery shopping once this past Monday and I am counting until 8 days pass to “clear myself” mentally. I came home from my grocery trip and wiped down all my groceries with disinfecting wipes. I wore a mask and disposable gloves while shopping. I live with my parents who are both 60+ and who do not seem to take Covid-19 seriously. My dad went grocery shopping on Wednesday (even though I already went) to grab a couple more things. They think if they run in and out of the store (10 min) they will not become infected. I keep telling them Corona doesn’t have a “10 minute rule”. Since they are both retired they are so used to just coming and going. I have already managed to get into 3 major arguments with them over this in the past 2 weeks. They don't seem to grasp that every time they leave the house they are putting their spouse and myself at risk of contracting the virus. My sister is 36 weeks pregnant and overwhelming by saying if me and my parents don't watch, we won't be allowed to look after my nephew when she goes into labour. She won't even let us go over to her house, she lives 5 minutes from us. The only time I leave the house is once a day to walk my dog. This whole situation is just exhausting.

136,1585354872,SoreButWhole,Away from significant other,"Don’t really know how to start this but I figured I would just put what I am feeling down in words and send it out there.

I am currently in the first week of a stay at home/work from home order which is probably not new to any of us here. My girlfriend and I are apart for the duration of this order and it really saddens me. I have a job that allows me to continue to work remotely and not lose any income which I know is a blessing. My girlfriend works in the healthcare field but is not exposed to COVID-19 directly and is also able to work remotely so we are not strapped financially.

When the work from home/stay at home order was first issued I was initially dismissive as I thought it would not affect us. I figured we would still be able to see each other despite us living in two households. That thought quickly disappeared as she made it clear she intends to stay with a close friend who lives alone. As a medical professional she has advocated for the shutdown from the start so I understand where she is coming from and I also understand the need for social distancing to flatten the curve.  

I experience “waves” throughout the day. I experience these really low feelings when I think about the open-endedness of this time away from her. Then I start to think about all of the time we were together but not present in the moment and it just reminds me that minutes are precious. We also have complete opposite work schedules where I am a day worker and she works nights. So while I am working she is usually doing her errands and other work stuff and when she is working, she is REALLY working and focused as she needs to be. Occasionally, I will experience a “high” but really that just means I am focused on a work issue or something else like working out that distracts me from my feelings.

Our communication has dropped and it does worry me a little. I know that we are both trying to adjust to the new normal and it will take some time. As a couple I think we are pretty strong. For my part, I try to make sure she knows how I feel about her so she doesn’t have to wonder. I am pretty open about how I feel and I try my best to share that stuff with her, good and not so good. For some reason I am having a hard time connecting with her and I don’t really know why. I don't expect her to feel the same as I do and on some level I hope she doesn't because I want her to be happy but it sucks thinking that she might not be feeling the same.  

I feel like a big part of my heart is gone and I am hesitant to tell her that because I don’t want her to think I am being dramatic or trying to make her feel a certain way. I needed to be able to tell someone (anyone) that and I am just thankful that this subreddit exists for me to do so.

I know my problems absolutely pale in comparison to thousands of other’s situations. I also know that some people are in the opposite situation and are “stuck” with their significant others and are going nuts.

147,1585361897,NoRealImage,Adive - Should I go to work or stay home and risk the financial consequences,"Hello,

I was wondering if any of you give me an opinon/advice on what the right course of action is. I live in Ontario (Canada) and I work full-time at a warehouse. We do not ship out anything essential but it is still legal for us to be open. I take two buses to get to work and I am terrified of contracting Covid-19. I am 24 and in good health but my dad is 60 years old and my mom is 52 with a host of serious mental health problems. I do not want to bring this virus home, but at the same time I am scared of asking work to lay me off. 

They wont penalize me for it, but I am scared of the financial consequences. To be honest I am in a better position than others financially. I do have savings but I am a student who intends to use most of that money for school but I live with my parents and do not pay rent. I help them with bills and while my parents arent well off they are at least stable financially speaking. However I know this virus is throwing Canada and the world into a bad reccession. I initally agreed to work despite the pandemic because I thought it would be wiser to work a lot and save money to prepare for the recession, especially since I recieved a temporary raise of $17 (CDN). Also I have severe ADHD so having some sort of structure is helpful and keeps me from letting myself go. Buisness is booming at the moment but how long will that last? We ship out stuff related to hobbies and the like not exactly the things people buy during a recession. Will I even be able to come back to my job after things calm down, whenever that is?

I am doing my best to keep a distance from people, but I am worried it is not enough. As more days pass and the fear and paranoia in the news and in society increases so does my anxiety. I almost burst into tears at work today cause I was scared of contratcing the virus and taking it home. I don't know anymore if deciding to work rather than isolate is a good idea. Every time a public service announcement comes on the TV it tells people to stay at home as much as possible and here I am working. 

Between my parents income and my savings I might be okay or I might not be. The uncertanity and anxiety is driving me insane and I don't know if I am just going to trade one concern for another. I don't know what to do. If anyone has any advice on this situation that would be appreciated and any tips on how to stay sane.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fqbdm1/adive_should_i_go_to_work_or_stay_home_and_risk/
149,1585362305,PlayfulTitan18,I just need to let this off my chest,"Lately I have just been feeling nothing but overwhelmed by this pandemic.  Some days I am fine I continue my daily routine of getting out of bed, going to work, going back home and repeat. I try to do my favorite things to keep myself entertained, but lately I don't even think that is working. I feel like I am just starting to lose my happiness.  


When I drive out for what I need or heading to work I see the roads almost nearly empty. Places I normally loved to go to like my local parks, mall, stores all of it is just shut down now and it sucks. I know everyone is going through it and I know the reasoning behind it all. It just hurts to see everything so empty.  


I haven't been able to see any of my friends either. A huge connection I had to socializing as an introvert was meeting up with my local friends to play Pokemon Go. I loved that and it was a huge part of my life just feels like it was taken away. You might think it's silly I am upset over a game, but it's more than just a game. It was a way for me to be myself and to see wonderful people who loved the same stuff I did. Also even if my best friend lived closer I know I shouldn't be seeing him.   


Then comes the most difficult part of what I decided to do lately was to at least limit the amount of time I see my girlfriend. Normally we love to hang out over the weekend, but this weekend I said we should really at least quarantine ourselves for at least two weeks so to skip this weekend. I know it's not permanent and i'll likely see her soon, but it was hard to do. We also had two events that we were really looking forward to going to get cancelled.  


It's just all a lot to take in.

I also found out that based on my 2018 tax return, I won't qualify for the stimulus check, because I was a student then and my mom listed me as a dependent. I no longer receive financial support from family, and I'm sure there are others in this situation as well. I tried to quickly do my 2019 taxes so they would look at that instead, but the website I have to access to get one of my returns is down until further notice and I can't contact support because they're closed due to the virus. I also almost got scammed on UpWork today when looking for remote freelance work.

I just feel like I can't win. I was only just now getting financially stable after finishing school last May. It has been my dream to move to New York my entire life, so I did right after graduation. I've essentially been living paycheck to paycheck since I got here, but I was finally just within the past couple of months starting to make more money, and it feels like my progress doesn't even matter now.

[https://ehs.stanford.edu/reference/comparing-different-disinfectants](https://ehs.stanford.edu/reference/comparing-different-disinfectants)

  **70% Ethanol**  
 Aqueous alcohol solutions are not appropriate for surface  decontamination because of the evaporative nature of the solution; a  contact time of ten minutes or more is necessary and not achievable  using a 70% (v/v) aqueous solution of ethanol. 70% ethanol can be used  to soak small pieces of surgical instruments and for wipe downs  following a disinfectant (e.g., 10% bleach) that might leave a corrosive  residue. 

 

### 70% Isopropyl Alcohol Solution

**Recommended Use**   

&amp;#x200B;

* Cleaning some instruments
* Cleaning skin

**How It Works**    

&amp;#x200B;

* Changes protein structure of microorganism
* Presence of water assists with killing action

**Advantages**

&amp;#x200B;

* Fairly inexpensive

**Disadvantages**

&amp;#x200B;

* 50% Solution not very effective -Not active when organic matter present
* Not active against certain types of viruses
* Evaporates quickly
* Contact time not sufficient for killing 

**Comments &amp; Hazards**

* Flammable
* Eye Irritant
* Toxic",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fqg1zu/does_rubbing_alcohol_actually_kill_the_virus_on/

I checked pulses and it feels pretty normal. It's not unbearable. But I am so scared I might get heart attack at random moment and die alone.

To top it all off, my uni barely understands how to move everything online, and is setting up to basically drop anyone without a solid internet connection out of anything. And this is all *before* things have truly begun to get bleak here in the US. The sheer amount of misinformation and fake news floating around doesn't help as well.

We've all been off work and staying home for 2-3 weeks now and I have not been displaying symptoms nor has anyone else here as far as I know. I have been bouncing back in between my house and my girlfriend's ( I know many people would question why I'd allow contact with her right now, but she's the closest thing to family I have, she is essentially) a few minutes away but not going out unless necessary other than that.

Quarantine with a bunch of young people who are friends is weird. We're not supposed to have gatherings or seeing other people in general, but I think it's likely that if anyone in my home has the virus, we've all been exposed at this point, as well as my girlfriend. So people have been lax about hanging out with each other within my house? We've mostly been keeping to ourselves anyways but tonight for example we had a ""house prom"" and just had everyone in the house dressed up and was hanging out in our front lawn. None of this was my idea, it feels like maybe we're not taking it seriously enough, but I also can't really control 13 people especially if this is going to be a multiple month situation which is looking more and more likely.

I tried hunkering down with my girlfriend at her place but I was worried that her roommates didn't want me to stick around for too long so I feel like I have to spend time both here and there. Which makes me nervous and her nervous.

I’m doing my best to cope, but as someone who is obsessive about preventing uncomfortable situations - this fucking sucks. I’m doing my best to adapt to this new “normal”, but it’s really hard especially when you don’t have roommates or anyone to focus on the present with.

She gave it to my friend, and somehow it bypassed his fiance but got her father, who is now on oxygen in the ICU, and most likely not going to make it. My friend who now has it also has severe asthma. I believe I have it as well, because i've had odd symptoms here and there, coughing fits, body aches, chest pain, but chalked them up to anxiety, as I have severe anxiety and panic disorder in the best of times. My father has severe COPD and is a goner if he gets this, but I have nowhere to go at the moment. He's also still out in the world, working, as he's essential. but he's pushing 60 and has COPD.

On top of all of this, I ran out of my anxiety medication because the last two weeks have been so stressful, and my doctor refuses to renew my script early or up my doseage (i've been on it for almost ten years, with no incident) and I can't get it until the 4th, which means i'll be going through withdrawls on top of rebound anxiety on top of stress from this whole situation.

Even before I ran out of my meds, I had flu-like symptoms, chest tightness and body aches, and i'm only 27. My immune system is also garbage, I get the flu or a very bad cold that leaves me bedridden at least once a year. The symptons my friend has and the symptoms I think i'm feeling line up with the incubation time, because we know who the idiot who spread it is, and can deduce our last exposure to them.

I already suffer from anxiety and panic attacks in an extreme manner, I have clinical depression, I most likely have covid, my best friend has it, his fiance's father is dying from it, and for all I know I already spread it to my family without knowing. I was denied a test, my friend only managed to get one because he works as a psychiatric counselor.

I don't think I can get through the week of hell to come, between all of this sickness, unsureity, the benzodiazepine withdrawls that are already starting to kick in, not knowing if I have it or not.

171,1585399950,n0cturnalowl,"Being Told To Come Into Work - Advice Needed (England, UK)","For some context, I work in a payroll department for a recruitment healthcare company in England, UK, and as of the other day- the government outlined that we are only to go outside in the following circumstances:

* shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible
* one form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household
* any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person
* travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home

It's the latter one I'm having an issue with my work, and honestly- some conflict between myself and my family and loved ones. My management believe that what we are doing is essential because it is in the healthcare sector, and therefore everyone has to come in, however with the list of key workers, from what I understand recruiters &amp; people in finance aren't those, and therefore aren't essential. I understand that without finance- there's no pay for workers, but we are still being made to come into work.

More of an issue, is that hypothetically- the only thing that stops me from being able to be 100% functional at home is a printer. We use a system whereby we print out the time-sheets of our agency staff as part of our process, and the company want us in the office to do this. To give you context, our building is a huge communal office block, which whilst they have their own measures (lots of hand sanitisers etc - it's still a risk and requires me to trust that other people in the building as being as hygienic). In theory, yes I could buy a printer, but it's the principle that my company won't get me a printer to ensure my safety and health during these times. This is all because the company won't get me a printer.

I'm unsure as to whether I should make some form of complaint and if so- how. There is no HR (I'm technically the most qualified person there, but with no work experience- just a qualification), and I'm honestly worried about the reaction of my management as they don't have the best coping skills for these sorts of thing (personal experience, and experience of other people within my company). 

I also worry that if the situation here gets worse, there will be tougher restrictions and I won't be able to do my job at all, which would mean very minimal pay (as the company itself won't close, I most probably won't be entitled to furlough).

Meanwhile this covid nightmare happened and now I can't return I don't know when I will see him and the worst part is i don't believe i will ever see him again.. He is alone and lonely, thankfully I am with my beautiful family, all of who are in the risk factor. I kinda forbid myself to worry about them by focusing all my emergy on not seeing my boyfriend. The pain is so strong that I literally forbid myself to think about him and it hurts to see him on camera.

I try not to focus too much on the bad news, but it's so painful to see all these families around the world broken, because of this disease.

Despite all of our warnings and the government's, I still see at the pharmacy a lot of people who shouldn't be there, ex. 70 year old and over, immunocompromised patients, people who just can back from vacation, etc. Many people are still very combative and don't want to comply with our new procedures: physical distancing, no items passing, no cash payment, come at the pharmacy's only if there's a necessity, better to call the pharmacy instead of coming for questions and refills, etc.

I feel like some people still think it's a joke...

Do you have any specific new procedures at your workplace? How do you get customers to collaborate?

Where do I begin? I feel like vomiting because I am so terrified.

My husband and I have been having problems for a while, but everything came to a head this week. Two days ago, he broke his promise to me that I would always have a safe place here, and told me he wanted to divorce. 

I'm not here to get relationship advice. Regardless of who is to blame for my situation, this is the situation. And coronavirus makes it almost impossible to survive it. 

It is really really hard to find a job right now because of the economy tanking. I don't even know what jobs I can do given my mental health issues. There are no courts open for divorce lawyers because of coronavirus, so we can't start the proceedings. Some people on legaladvice told me that even if I find out my test is negative and I go stay with a friend, it will disadvantage me in the divorce process later for some reason they didn't really explain well. They say don't leave the house under any circumstances. We are trying to do teletherapy, but my therapist is completely overburdened by all of the other people dealing with massive life crashes due to coronavirus, including losing loved ones and losing their income, etc. Every friend of mine is stretched to the max so I am here dealing with all of these intense feelings of fear totally alone. I'm afraid of losing more friends. My emotional neediness has always been a problem for me but now it is not only making the symptoms worse, but making recovery harder.

I am so so so so fucked. I HAD a safe place to be, my husband's job isn't affected by the virus because he worked from home anyway. He was willing to take care of me.

I get that death rates are a more concrete number than ""quality-of-life"" rates, and since a lot of people do seem to want to be alive then I'm happy for them if death rates go down. But for me personally, it just makes me feel like other legitimate fears are being dismissed like ""but did you die?""",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fqn1d9/why_is_everyone_only_worried_about_death_rates/
181,1585413311,furyofsunsets,A little break from the worry and anxiety...,"I have never had more anxiety than now, at this unprecedented time in our history. In the first week or so of quarantine, I felt that my anxiety would not stop until this was over. And when would that be? Two, three months from now?! How could I bare to wake up every day knowing I would have feelings of hopelessness and helplessness every waking minute. I worry about my parents, who still go to stores when they need something. I worry about my boyfriend, who has an autoimmune disorder. I worry about his parents and grandparents. It is all too much. 

But I found a saving grace, and a way to get rid of all of the noise, even just for an hour - YOGA AND MEDITATION. 

Maybe some of you have started this during quarantine too, and maybe some of you are thinking about it. So I am here to say that it has not only helped me escape for a short period of time in the day, but it has actually helped my anxiety even after class is over. I never thought it would, but after three straight days, I feel a little more at peace with myself. 

Don't get me wrong, I still worry, and this is not a cure all for anxiety, but the high levels of panic have subsided for the most part. I can't say this is all attributed to the classes, but I know they are part of it! 

So, if you can, go online and see what classes are being offered virtually. Many instructors are hosting free classes, and others at very low price. It gives you some social interaction (even if you don't turn your camera on like me) and gives your mind and body a rest.

Anyway, long post, but give it a try. You might like how you feel. : )",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fqngvo/a_little_break_from_the_worry_and_anxiety/

So my question is: if I do have it, when am I no longer contagious?? I believe CDC says 7 days after symptoms disappear, 3 days after fever breaks (i have no fever)

Question 2: isn’t everyone gonna get it eventually??? If it spreads this easy?? Is it fruitless for her to avoid me because she’s just gonna get it anyway when quarantine is over?

I have no pre existing health conditions (that I know of)I constantly think I have it (I’m convinced I have it now as I have a slight burn in the left side of my throat, had it for two days), I check my temperature at least 3 times a day.
Everyone coughs in my house, including myself as I clear my throat a lot. I have in laws that are smokers and my wife has a bit of hay fever so is coughing everyday, not continuously, just throughout the day. 
I have good days and then bad days. I was so bad last week I felt like my body was on fire so was convinced I had it, my wife touched me and said I had no warmth whatsoever!  My father in law was coughing in the night as he’s a smoker, so I timed every cough. First it was 15 mins, then every 5, they every 3, then it was periodic, then I had to convince myself that the frequency was changing so I eventually went to sleep about an hour later. 
My wife is a manager at a hospital and my mother in law is a maternity nurse , so both are at hospitals where there is a good chance they can contract it.
I freak out everytime someone coughs and I can’t shift  negative thoughts. My wife dieing alone, myself dieing alone, my 3 year old daughter getting ill, it terrifies me. I am scared of everything, especially hospitals so I picture myself on a ventilator and having all sorts of injections. I live in fear everyday. The only comfort I take from this all is the County where I live only has 20 known cases. But I’m currently just waiting for the cough or fever to hit as I have a slight sore throat, that’s doesn’t even feel sore. I’m exhausted with all this. I try to think positive but it’s so hard to push the negative thoughts out. I’ve had to stop reading and watching the news as it makes me so ill. I’m also stressing about if one of us gets it how we self isolate as there is 5 of us in a 3 bed house. We were due to move on the 3rd and that would of made me less anxious but that can’t happen now due to the lockdown.

198,1585430790,sarun_23,"I'm doing my best and still breaking down. Please, I need comfort and advice.","The virus entered my country a month ago. 

The past few weeks I've been struggling with my mom (58). She was proud to lead her regular life and just doing the absolute minimal: washing her hands. She kept doing all of the other things you're not supposed to. I had my first breakdown around then. It was an awful week and we kept fighting about it. There was no convincing her with a civilized talk. But eventually, with a little help, she almost miraculously realized how important her cooperation is and was on board with every safety measure and haven't left the house since. It TREMENDOUSLY helped relieve my stress levels. 

Then there is my uncle (60+), who lives with us. He is just not willing to understand, going out (almost) every day to do grocery shopping by the piece. We tried to talk to him but this is the type of human being who is NOT willing to cooperate or really support anyone under any circumstance. He's an asshole like that. He won't understand even if his own mother who is 91 lives with us. Everytime he leaves the house I get into so much panic and stress that won't go away unless I clean and disinfect every area he is in and touches after entering the house. The only days where I'm sort of at peace are when no one leaves the house. 

I've been the only one in this household who has taken this seriously enough since the beginning and the only one responsible for raising awareness, organizing cleaning rounds, safety measures and sharing information, correcting processes and such. 

On the other hand, I'm in a long distance relationship and my boyfriend isn't really of much help. He has been insinuating I'm exaggerating with all of this and got mad at me for asking if he took a shower after moving from one state to another. He took offense on that and thought THAT justified him in being a jerk to me. Never apologized. I don't trust him anymore when it comes to talking about my anxiety and fear of all of this. I don't know when will we be able to visit each other. 

And even after all of that I was sort of managing. I discovered cleaning and disinfecting the house really helped me ease down a lot. Everytime I felt bad, I resorted to either cleaning or comfort myself with reassuring words and reasoning. Maybe not much but I've always been kind of unstable and being able to do this all by myself was a huge step for me. I felt in control and strong enough. 

And then it happened. I'm recovering from a cold I caught before the first case of covid19 was detected in my country. But there's a residual cough that won't go away. I talked to my mom about how I'm worried about that and she accused me of hiding information about being with someone who was already infected. I hadn't been out much other than grocery shopping and always had extreme precautions. I don't know where it came from. It took me off guard and it totally destroyed me. It ended in a fight again. I spent most of the day crying in my room, suicidal thoughts triggered, unable to feel anything other than rage and hurt. It felt as if all of the stress and fear I thought I had successfully managed up until then came pouring down on me. I haven't been able to recover. I feel like crap, I only want to sleep all day. Today, I don't feel as angry anymore but I really don't want to do anything, be it cleaning, getting off of bed, nor even eating. 

Last night, I went to bed early, hoping a bit more of sleep would help me feel better in the morning. But these voices woke me up. Laughter. Somebody freaking coughing. I looked out the window and there was a group of 3 people from the building next to my house hanging out on the roof, smoking, everyone next to each other and one of the guys was coughing in the general direction of my house. It triggered my anxiety SO BAD, I was shaking, about to cry and wasn't able to sleep until 7 am. People in my country are definitely not taking this seriously and I can't even describe how that makes me feel.


I don't know what to do. I don't know how to handle all of this anymore. I feel so lonely in this battle. I don't have many friends and I feel like they're tired of me talking about this, I don't want to push them away. I wish my family was really united and cared about this. I feel terrible, I can't even describe it....

TL;DR: uncle over 60 putting at risk an entire household of people with all the risk factors by carelessly going out everyday in a country full of people that doesn't take this seriously.

199,1585431806,Hopanfree,"Covid, terror and OCD","24M 
Since I suffer from OCD, this pandemic is decisely threatening my mental health. Basically this situation is allowing OCD to torture myself. It's more than a month that my country is struggling because of Covid-2019.
During these days I have often measured my body temperature, always finding values less than or equal to 98,06 °F (36,7 °C). Sometimes I get caught in obsessive thoughts and my anxiety rises, and as I hear my heartbeat increasing, I start to become afraid or paranoid (but it has always happened), but when I calm down my heartbeat returns normal. 
Moreover it's sufficient that I cough 2 times throughout an entire day to panic, and I also tend to develop an obsessive control of my breathing, as well as an obsessive waiting of a coughing episode that never arrives.
All this is not only linked to my fear of getting the disease, but also to my fear not to recognize symptoms of the disease and to unconsciously infect someone. It's always a battle between 2 sides of my thoughts: ""stop to compulsively control yourself, you're only worsening your mental condition"" vs ""you need to carefully control your state of health, otherwise you will be an irresponsible person and you could be blamed if you infect someone"".
Do you have some advice?
How do i have to behave about checking my temperature? Are there some time bands in which temperature measurment is more opportune and hours of the day in which it is not appropriate? From which temperature values Should I start to get worried? Are there some differences during the day?

She screams if anybody leaves the house because ""she just knows they'll get infected and bring it back"". She screams if people don't listen to her because ""she just knows best"".

207,1585435224,alecubudulecu,Wynn hotel staff stuck head in my car window - during quarantine,"wife and I went for a drive last night. we live in las vegas suburbs. we get groceries delivered, and don't interact with people - all CDC and news says driving is ok.  so we assumed so.

we went by the vegas strip to see how empty it is.  there were police EVERYWHERE.  that made me feel good... I was happy they are ramping up security. other than cars, no one really around.

casinos closed.

as we drove , some roads blocked.  as we passed Wynn - a road was blocked, and police motioned for us to use the Wynn entry to do a U turn.

so we did.  as we go through - right at the entry point - 5 Wynn security guards circle our car.  blocking path. and they keep motioning to roll window down.  flashlights pointed at us.

I tried to motion that we doing U TURN. ... they drew closer... and one started banging on the window to roll the window down.  I cracked the window open.

I screamed out so he could hear ""we are doing a u turn!""

he goes ""I know but I need to see your face"".

at that point my options were - to run them over - or open the window.  they were completely surrounding the car in that moment. so I rolled the window down.

and - he proceeded to shove his face IN OUR CAR to get a good look at us. and breathe on us.

ii was FURIOUS.  I wanted to get out and yell at him.  but I figured the quicker we get out of there the safer.  so we drove home.  it resulted in anxiety for a few hours for us.

I have ideas for next time - maybe drive less haha.  but also maybe have a sign I can post to the windshield in these cases telling idiots like this to BACK THE F- UP from the car.

statistically i'm sure it's fine... but now i'm contacting corporate. i'm gonna need them to monitor that staff employee and let me know asap if they get sick.

what kind of imbecile service industry training is this? during a quarantine, when you've shut down your hotels and casinos, have countless infected IN your work... you are training people to put their heads in cars???? do they not realize there's a social distancing/quarantine in effect?

I also get they were anxious and nervous. they likely wanted to make sure we not going on the property to do damage.  I get it.

I'm a cashier at an essential retailer in Colorado. For the past two weeks I've had a mild cough, so I've been trying to come in as little as possible. On tuesday I thought that my cough had gone away so I came to work, but about halfway through my shift I started having breathing problems. I've been home since then and my breathing got worse, plus a dry cough and now sore throat. Unsure if I have a fever, as we don't own a thermometer. Aside from having to breathe heavier, I feel fine enough, so I plan on waiting this out at home for now. But I'm really worried about spreading this to coworkers/customers - moreso if it is COVID.

I've been using up some emergency sick time, but since I've been sick all of the past week too, I'm almost out of it. My work allows us to take a 2-week leave of absence, but it's unpaid. We do have a policy in place that gives unpaid time if we're ordered to self-quarantine, or if we're diagnosed.

Because of all this, I've been thinking of calling my PCP to see if I can get a self-quarantine order, so that I don't have to choose between my livelihood and the health of those around me. I don't want to add to the overload on the healthcare system though, and I also don't know how to confront the issue, because I don't want to demand a doctor's note. Testing here is scarce, so that's unlikely too.

I work in a very niche job of critical care transport, in a relatively large metropolitan area. I have transported many confirmed cases, and our area is initial stages of this pandemic.  I work out of a hospital as a vendor (due to state legislature).

219,1585450795,Alastiana,"I feel like I am starting to ""grieve"" my (very much alive) stubborn 88 year old mother.","I live abroad, in a country currently on locked down, and feel tremendously powerless. I've begged my mother to stay home and, for a while, it seemed that she was listening. However, it has come to my attention that she constantly lies about how often she leaves the house. This was a tremendous shock for me, as I always thought we had a very honest relationship - it honestly broke my heart.

My mother doesn't have any severe health issues aside from high cholestrol levels. However, she shares a house with a long time friend, another elderly lady, who's diabetic. I've tried to make her understand that she's putting her friend's life at risk, but this friend is just as bad, so they are actually enabling each other's behavior. They're both both retired nurses who think they know how to go about their day and still be safe.

It is my understanding that she has been running errands several times a week. She has access to government services that would help her with the groceries, but is apparently too proud to use them. She is also still visiting her sister who, unfortunately, is severely affected by psychosis and, therefore, very likely to completely neglect all precautions, such as hand washing and social distancing. I've attentemped to make suitable arrangements for my aunt, such as having other relatives check on her, but my mother refuses to, in her own words, abandon her sister.

I don't know what to do. I've experienced a wide range of emotions over this, from helplessness to rage, but mostly depression and anxiety. Due to childhood trauma, I  have a history of extreme escapist behavior, which causes me to mentally and emotionally disengage with things that I feel like I can't hold on to. At this stage, I feel like I am disengaging (thus ""grieving"") with my mother - but when I'm not feeling numb, I am panicking about it.

**Imagine** if it was possible to BUILD a ventilator using less than $200 in parts available at home or at hardware stores, and imagine if we were able to teach almost anyone to do this with stuff readily available within a 15 minute drive.

We wouldn't have to worry about shortages due to the exploding coronavirus situation, would we ?

Don't have to imagine too much. Its pretty much available right now: :

DC power supply- Breathing tube.- And a blower, which, the guy in the video says it's just a standard brushless dc motor.

**Very rudimentary, but probably the cheapest one I was able to find.**

&amp;#x200B;

They can be easily modified with pressure regulators and ICs which work better for patients with fluid in the lungs. Those portable devices, are not expensive and are available at hardware shops, hobby shops, etc.

\----------------------

**Imagine if someone made a video or released information on how such a portable device could be built by anyone ?**

Then imagine if everybody who is now sitting at home collecting free money, just went out and made one with parts available from ordinary electronics and hardware shops (well maybe slightly better hardware shops), and normal DIY tools and equipment? And they sent all of it to central points where qualified mechanics or engineer friends would test them and tweak them for the next 12-24 hours. And when they pass muster, these are sent to the hospitals that need them for them to use for the next 3 months until proper $20k (now $40k) ventilators are shipped in.

No need to buy a bmw when you can make a bicycle to do the job that is needed in the short term right now. Any other issues can be solved by the same DIY inventor's mindset that created this device. This is not perfect, but it saves lives until the best solutions arrive. Remember, its better to have an imperfect ventilator compared to no ventilator at all. It will also stop the industry from ripping hospitals off by jacking up the prices of ventilators etc at this emergency time. This is, of course, the ONLY reason why industry has not stepped up to fix things even though they've had so much warning that it would be needed.

Btw, the **same basic idea - diy methods that are advertised for everyone** to use from home - can be used to create basic personal protective equipment for hospitals, including certain types of masks. As long as it is cheap, people will gladly donate their personal time and money for this purpose.

**Someone will take it and run with it. Spread the word, people.**

They won’t test my wife in Connecticut because of the lack of supplies but she was in direct contact with the coworker who is now hospitalized with her husband on a respirator. We are both in our 30s and I informed my work immediately and we are self quarantining. 

We’ve been doing all the right stuff: we stocked up, we have cash on hand and we are taking our temps/getting rest and water. We have no symptoms yet besides a mild cough I’ve had for a few weeks (I might have had bronchitis? I dunno) and her temperature started rising today. 96.9,  97.1 and now 98.2 still below normal but tracking up.

She has anxiety and all of the sudden I do too. I NEVER get anxious but honestly I’m terrified. I have hyperthyroidism and her mom has MS. That’s our biggest worry: her mom. She visited her at least once, possibly twice since infected. If she gets this... it’s not great. 

I’m trying to ease her anxiety by telling her the truth: we may have it but we are over educated on the symptoms, have plenty of stock and are young but damn... you can’t turn on ANYTHING without doom and gloom. I know everyone on the planet is in similar situations but I just had to throw mine in the void. If we get sick, we get sick. Odds are good we’ll be ok.

Many if not all of his co-workers wear gloves and mask all day long and his response was.. “I probably wouldn’t wear that stuff, I use the sanitizer at least twice a day though.” 

I truly didn’t know how to respond to his response. I feel like he’s being selfish and doesn’t even care about us at all. 

Fast forward a few hours and I finally decided to have that dreadful conversation with him once again and asked him to please be more cautious and mindful. Use hand sanitizer more often and wear a mask if needed. At this point he starts to get upset with me and says he wishes he would just get the virus just so it would over with already.

27M. Thanks to the mods for the approval.

I dont know what to feel or think thru all this. I watch the news everyday, and I just assume that it'll be over in a month. Maybe I'm just too optimistic but i just want things to go back to normal.

I would say the hardest thing about all of this is missing my parents. I live just 10 miles away, but i would feel awful if i visited and something Happened. they're both in their 50s and thats enough for me to stay away. I would see them every week before any of this, and now this is the longest I've ever gone without seeing them. Sure we facetime, but its just not the same.

Then theirs the worry about me getting the virus. I'm a fairly normal 27 year old, besides the fact that i had cancer in 2018. Currently in my 2nd year of remission; never had to do chemo. So i wouldn't categorize myself in the immunocompromised category. it is putting a damper on my yearly checkups, my doctors are doing phone-calls rather than seeing me in person, and I guess CT scans are being limited to emergency scenarios. I feel like not only do i have to be paranoid about my cancer returning, but now I'm paranoid about getting corona too.

On the bright side of all this, I'm still employed as my industry is all computer work. and my fiance is also working from home. We're set to get married in 2021, but now I'm wondering if it'll all be over by then.

I have the impression that the lockdown and the unfolding global pandemic situation has been quite hard on my partner’s (31/M) mental health. We have been self-quarantined for almost two weeks now, and ever since it started, he became extremely distant emotionally, he hardly ever engages in any activity, does not really fulfill his work-related duties and his behavior changed quite substantially. His sleeping patterns are a mess, he is awake until 5 am-ish, sleeps until midday or even longer, he is extremely irritated and when he is awake he plays some online games non-stop. This is a very big change, as he used to be a much more active and motivated person. We normally have a very loving and balanced relationship, but he stopped sharing his thoughts and worries with me, and therefore I have no idea how could I help him to feel better. My problem is obviously not that he is acting “lazy”, but I’m very worried that he is sliding into a depressive period. 

We are in Europe, our country is not really affected so far, but his only living relative, his elderly mother lives alone in New York and I believe he worries a lot about her. A few days ago I caught some words from their Skype call, and I heard that they discussed her will and potential funeral arrangements. I believe he must be in a horrible pain emotionally and I want to be there for him, but it’s very hard as he really gives me no clue how.

Im in a very high risk group... if I get it things will not go well.  But Im older than most redditors so this isn't my first rodeo and there is something important about what is going on.  We each have to make a decision about how we are going to let the stress and uncertainty affect us mentally as people.  We can cower and be afraid and think to ourselves 'My gawd when will this be over?!', or we can say to ourselves ""OK.  This is going on.  I need to do X for me to stay safe and to keep those I love safe.  This won't last forever.  But more importantly I will do everything I can to not get this.  If I do, however, then it was just my time and we all have a time and date appointment we can't extend out no matter what.  My goal here is to do everything I can, to the best of my ability and then be calm and accept the outcome.'  Being scared is natural.  But if you can put the fear aside you will find that this is an opportunity for personal emotional growth.  I believe (in my opinion) this mental framework will make the psychological recovery from this easier on the other side even if no one you know dies.

We’re currently as safe as we can be—have been at home for about 4 weeks. I lost my job, and am finishing grad school from home, and my wife is working from home, so we don’t have to leave the apartment except when necessary. Right now, we feel anxious but relatively insulated—however, I can’t help but imagine the worst case scenario in which one of us gets sick, and the hospitals here are so overrun that we won’t be able to get health care. We’re young and healthy but I’m worried about one of us getting very sick.

Is it the smart play to take my parents’ advice? The virus of course is in California, but things are not looking nearly as dire there as they are here. It feels like a difficult choice to uproot everything indefinitely—and my mother-in-law is in the NYC as well, so I know my wife is reticent to leave her.

261,1585504603,Username8891,Useful Resource Recommendation-Actually Valid Self Help Book written by the Creators of Cognitive Behavior. How to Find &amp; Recommended Use,"Last night, I remembered a valuable resource recommended to me by a therapist. The creators of cognitive behavioral therapy wrote a book discussing how to moderate the intensity of your reactions to situations. It is called *A Guide to Rational Living* written by Albert Ellis &amp; Robert Harper. The oldest edition is available in archives.org for free to borrow digitally (may contain more biases therapists had at the time), while the most up to date edition is available from multiple sellers for fairly low cost. On Amazon, I see for $5 to $25 after tax/shipping. 

For people unfamiliar with cognitive behavioral therapy, the idea is that your emotions are valid, but sometimes the intensity of thoughts attached to them can create maladaptive behavior. These maladptive thoughts are to be identified and challenged so the feelings are not so overwhelming. It is normal and healthy to experience fear/grief right now. The idea of targeting such thoughts is to not become immobilized by worry/anxiety/hopelessness/despair. 

Some people might be able to use the book alone easily enough, but it is recommended that if you are having a particularly hard time that you have someone to discuss it with that has some grasp of cognitive behavioral therapy, at least to start. I imagine it would also be a good book to discuss with friends who are struggling.

The thoughts that occurred to me is that I can't control the CDC, federal government, or friends who put themselves at risk, but I can control my exposure to the virus and how I use my waking hours for productivity/connection that I felt were missing. Instead of worrying/obsessing about what people do wrong, I can discuss what I understand of safety protocols with people who understand the threat there is and try to frame the discussion calmly and persuasively for those who do not see it yet. If persuasion doesn't work, I can either rework my message or accept that I tried and the person is responsible for their own actions.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/fra1lp/useful_resource_recommendationactually_valid_self/

My boyfriend has still been going to work, although won't be for the next two weeks, but I understand that he doesn't have a choice and he takes whatever precautions he can. Housemate has been working from home for a while now. 

Government advice/instruction in the UK where we are - not that I trust our prime minister in the slightest - is that we go out only for essential exercise or shopping for essential groceries etc, unless we absolutely have to go out for work.

Today my housemate walked all the way across town (and I mean seriously all the way across town, more than an hour's walk, plenty of shops still open down the road from us), for another trip to another supermarket... She's already been to one and bought a load of food this week. I know she's feeling stressed like everyone and needed to have some time outside, but there are beautiful and mostly deserted places near our house that she could have gone to.

She got the bus home. When she got home she didn't immediately go and wash herself. She picked up a cup and a bowl from the front room, and stroked the cat.

For the most part the three of us have been getting on very well so far. I'm very fond of her and I don't feel like I have it in me to get openly angry at her about this. But I feel that she has unnecessarily put my life at risk today.

(I'm very fortunate to be living here during this pandemic). I have 4 adult children and three weeks ago, three of them decided to leave other cities in California and shelter in place with us. Two kids brought along their significant others. We have a total of 8 people sheltering together in 3 different dwellings, including my MIL who is 87. Four of us are in a higher risk category - MIL's age, autoimmune disorders, and past tuberculosis/lung issues (I'm 60 years old and have the past lung issues). 

We've kept my MIL at a distance from everyone, per her request (we provide her with meals). The rest of us get together for dinners, play games, etc.

I think we've had very good practices. I stocked up on essentials soon after the outbreak of Covid19. We send one person for groceries and supplies when needed and try to limit any trips to the store.

The challenge is this: My daughter-in-law wants to visit her family who live 20 miles away and my daughter wants to see her boyfriend who is also close by. We are confident that the daughter-in-law's family has been very safe and the boyfriend has also practiced self isolation. Do we bend our rules and allow them to make these visits of other people who are following safe practices? Is there any research or articles on how to deal with this situation?

Okay sorry, now for the problem. I had to leave work to get my dad from the airport.

It was nice, seeing people trying to get something fun out of this whole pandemic thing. I post a picture of the gathering on my Snapchat. My roommate is outraged. She says I'm not following CDC guidelines and putting everyone in danger. I tell her I have been limiting my distance and washing/sanitizing my hands frequently. That gets overlooked of course and she goes straight into I can't be around her (or her boyfriend) if I'm just going to ignore what her and the CDC says. I explain I'm not ignoring anyone, and if she wants I can just stay in my room, I don't want to leave the apartment I'm also paying for. This escalates by her saying that her, her boyfriend and his dad pay more than I do. That's upsetting. She then goes on to say how I feel isn't as important as their health. Okay cool I guess. At this point I'm crying and my cousin slides me an extra few dollars so I can get something to eat. I leave and get takeout from McDonald's. I told her I would just stay in my room and that I'm not repeating myself. So thats what I did (and I'm still doing). I don't know how to get through to her without having to feel like I am being completely ignored. What makes it worse is that her boyfriend (not that I expect him to side with me or anything) isn't seeing why I'm having a difficult time with this. Any help will be appreciated, I'm kinda tired of being in my room and I want to eat something else that isn't potato chips.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/frcrp0/my_roommate_and_i_have_been_fighting_alot_because/
270,1585515743,hammertimex95,Coronavirus and work,"So I'm considered an essential worker here in PA. I work in an auto parts warehouse. Covid-19 has totally messed me up in the head. I used to have problems with anxiety, but as I got older(I'm  25 now) I have found ways to cope. However, this whole pandemic has thrown me right back into my old ways.
    
On one hand I'm very grateful to still have a place to make an income, on the other hand I just want to stay home and try to self-isolate. I just took a week off and used some PTO time to try and mentally get better at home . I feel safe here . However, I know that this week will probably not be the end of the pandemic and I will need to resume work next week.
   
  How can I go back to work and keep a level head? There's maybe 50-60 people in the building on my shift alone, and while they may chirp about how if anyone is sick they will be sent home immediately, all this talk of asymptomatic people is truly terrifying . People at my work don't listen to me when I say let's stick 6 ft away,they don't cover their mouths when they cough(I see so many do it) and everybody there pretty much acts like they don't care what's going on in the outside world and there isn't a pandemic going on.
    
  I want to continue to make an income and support myself so I most likely won't quit, but I would just like some advice about how to keep people away from me while at the same time not coming off like a jerk .Most of the day I'm driving around on a cherry picker PIT by myself,but there's times during the day that my team(15 of us) need to be by each other. I will relish the week and try to think positive. 
     My girlfriend is also a nurse in an allergy clinic(LPN) so that also is a concern to me(we live together),however her hours have been cut. I just want the both of us to be safe.

I live in a quiet neighborhood in Brooklyn and the lock down has taken a serious hit to my girlfriends' mental health. I'm actually more worried about losing her to suicide than her getting sick. I'm struggling too but I think she's at the end of her rope with everything happening.

I go to see her once a week. She lives 10 blocks away and she picks me up in her car. I've made us masks with filters and we go straight to her apartment. She's an extrovert and the only interaction she's had with anyone is with me and my family for the past month. It's been extremely hard on her and me. I'm worried when she doesn't text me back or call me in the morning....worried that I've lost her.

I could see they verified with my employers how much money I make and the reason I’m seeking unemployment.

I’m stressed because I have no idea if I am waiting on them, or they are waiting on me to send in something I’m unaware of. Nobody answers the phones or answers my chat request on their website. They’re just too busy and I’m not trying to complain or say it’s the employees fault.

Unfortunately they're not delivering so I called them and asked if we ordered on the phone if they could just put the food in the trunk, and they said yes. My plan was this. Pay on the phone, have them put the food in the trunk, and then come home and use a sterile technique to transfer the food onto some cookware and pop it in the oven for a few minutes.
But when I got there the guy bringing food out came to my window... I really had no choice but to roll it down. I kind of figured I needed to sign the receipt (I had hand sanitizer ready) but I wasn't prepared for him to get as close as he did... His face was pretty much where the window would have been had it been up. He didn't cough or sneeze but he did talk, asking if I had paid on the phone. I didn't have to sign.

294,1585528889,EdHuRus,I'm in a bit of a conundrum at the moment. I was hoping to get some advice on here. Should I go up north to live with my parents?,"I haven't posting much on here mostly because I need to keep calm during this trying times we are facing and I just didn't want to overwhelm myself and get scared. Now I am conflicted about something though.

I have been face-timing with my mom and dad since this all began. They have been quarantining and self isolating for the last two weeks since they got home from Arizona. They are doing fine, I talk to them almost everyday either on the phone or using facetime. 

Yesterday while face timing my mom was asking me to think about going up to live with them at their house even though we have a stay at home order. Our Gov. Evers of Wisconsin isn't going to be sending the National Guard out to stop us from leaving but I am still conflicted about this. 

In Wisconsin we have about 1,000 cases mostly in Milwaukee and in Madison with few cases where I live in Winnebago County. I haven't been out since last Wednesday when I took a leave of absence from work and besides doing some running and walking and ordering some delivery, I have not been in contact with virtually anyone. Where my parents live which is up north in Menominee County there have been no cases as of yet. 

I talked with someone that I know who actually lives in New Rochelle where the hotspot began and he told me that I should go since my parents have been self-isolating since coming back and its been two weeks.

The only problem is that my dad still goes out to get the groceries which he does wash his hands when he gets home from the store and the doors and surfaces are cleaned with wipes. 

I'm sorry to make this long but I need some help. I want to come live with them and be together as a family but I'm just worried that I might bring the virus to their home up north or they got exposed somehow whether it was my dad walking into a mist cloud of someone at the grocery store who coughed or something like that. And it doesn't help we don't have any masks since some assholes panic bought everything early on. 

Bottom line is, should I go and make the trip to go up north?

 I am not going to be stopping anywhere besides to live up north with my parents. I haven't been anywhere, my parents haven't gone to any crowded places since returning. I've been self isolating for almost two weeks now and by this Wednesday it would be two weeks since I self-isolated.  

I just don't know. I don't want to hurt my parents or make my mom feel bad, she said, ""It would mean a whole lot if you'd come up north, we are doing our best to keep isolated and stay safe.""",/r/COVID19_support/comments/frgxd7/im_in_a_bit_of_a_conundrum_at_the_moment_i_was/
295,1585529652,india_aj,A significant number of COVID-19 infected do not show any symptoms therefore masks are likely to have a major impact on the spread of COVID-19 virus in the community and everyone should wear one even if they are homemade.,"Given that a significant number of people infected with COVID-19 virus do not show any symptoms of the disease during its entire course, it is important that everyone should wear a mask to reduce the spread of virus in the community. Doing so will not only protect you, but will also reduce the spread of infection in case you are already infected but are not showing any symptoms of the disease. 

Even homemade masks are better than no masks provided the user learns proper handling of masks. Make your own masks at home and learn the proper technique before you start using them. Instructional videos and guidelines for making masks from household materials and proper handling of masks are easily available online. 

As regards efficacy, of the commonly available types, N95 masks are more effective than surgical three layer masks which are more effective than homemade cotton masks. N95 masks effectively filter out at least 95% of COVID-19 sized viral particles. A research study reported that household masks made from vaccum cleaner bags (86% filtering efficacy) are nearly as effective as surgical masks (90% filtering efficacy) in filtering out COVID-19 sized viruses. Other materials found in the study to provide good protection against virus sized particles are tea towels (73% filtering efficacy), cotton mix (70% filtering efficacy), antimicrobial pillowcases (69% filtering efficacy), linen (62% filtering efficacy), pillowcase (57% filtering efficacy), silk (54% filtering efficacy), 100% cotton t-shirts (51 % filtering efficacy) and scarves (49% filtering efficacy). It is important to note that the least effective homemade mask materials are also 50% as effective as surgical masks so even they provide some protection.

To reiterate, using a mask is always better than not using a mask provided you learn how to properly use a mask. But it is essential to also follow good hand hygiene measures and physical distancing guidelines, even when you are wearing a mask.

She's still being irresponsible. What can I do?","I tried having a conversation with her but she's incredibly stubborn. I told her that because we are now shelter in place in our state, her boyfriend cannot come over this weekend. She just said ""okay"" but in a way where it was obvious that he's still coming over, which he has.

I told her that shelter in place means we need to stay home. She said, ""no, I can leave."" I told her that this is literally the one thing they're asking us to do. She just doesn't care. She isn't taking this seriously, which is annoying because she's type 1 diabetic and should take it more seriously. Plus my father still unfortunately has to go to work and he has really bad asthma and if he gets the virus he would most likely die.

She's acting like this because she's convinced she already had the virus in December, but she just had a bad flu. I'm tired of people saying they already had the virus. You didn't!

She keeps gaslighting me too. She keeps saying I'm going crazy, I'm panicking, I don't care about her. I'm not going crazy though, I'm just being cautious and doing the one literal thing they're asking us to do. I'm actually very fine with staying in doors and being alone, it's quite natural for me. I just get anxious thinking about my family getting the virus because I don't think any of them would make it.

I've tried showing her the graphs and articles but she won't read them. I keep reading about people who were cautious but still got the virus, how their loved ones have died. She just doesn't seem to care.

What can I do? A part of me wants to go and stay with my parents during this two week shelter in place, but I'm worried. My dad, brother, and mother are all at the house and both my brother and father still have to work because they're ""essential.""

I just don't understand why she's doesn't care. There's no harm in being cautious. Better safe than sorry! I just moved in with her a month ago and her salary has been cut in half too so now I have to provide most of the money and I suddenly don't want to live with her. I had been living alone but decided to move in with her because it would be cheaper but I already regret it. I just hate it and I feel so stuck.

I told my mom to talk to her but I'm not even sure my mom could do much. My mental health is the worst it's been in a long time. I can't cope with this in general, just thinking about my parents getting sick and losing them. I haven't experienced death that often so I wouldn't know what to do with myself.

Her boyfriend is here now. He got here yesterday and it looks like he will stay the night again. I only left my room once today when they went to go get food, and I had wiped down everything with disinfectant wipes before touching anything. I don't know who he has seen before coming here. I've literally stocked food in my room, and I'm thankful I have my own private bathroom.

What can I do? Should I go to my parents' house? She just won't listen.

What an awful time we are all having! From unemployment to not being able to find toilet roll, to the fear of catching the virus to the fear of those around us dying from it. The last one is ringing true mostly for me. 

I live in Ireland and my mum lives in the UK. She has mild-moderate asthma so is fairly vulnerable. I can’t shake the feeling that she wouldn’t make it through if she caught it. And I keep seeing these ‘70% will be infected’ news headlines and they are scaring me even more.

At China for taking the virus seriously upon the initial discovery, and then more personally at my country, the supposedly greatest country in the world the U.S, at their reckless dismissal of the virus when it first broke in Washington state, the subsequent utter lack of preparedness, the lack of testing, ""social distancing"" well after it seems too late....why the fuck?

**Ask**: If you are Covid positive, or if you know someone who is, PLEASE message and we can provide further information. We just need a few hundred more people, out of the hundreds of thousands infected as of this writing.

311,1585539399,flashb4cks_,"TW for negativity, i guess. I'm too cynical and """"pessimist""""?","I am cynical.
There's a movement going around right now, people drawing rainbows everywhere with a french sentence that means ""it will be ok"". Those damn rainbows are EVERYWHERE. It's cute and all, but it just feels so.. Fake? 

I'm not completely apathetic, i understand that this movement is supposed to be to give people hope, bring them joy and happiness, i know we're in a time where people needs this kind of hope and i don't want people to be anxious all the time. 

But everytime i see it, i kind of roll my eyes on the inside. It irritates me. I don't think we're doomed, i believe i've got a pretty global and realistic view of the situation, i've been following this for months now.   I've been telling everyone for over a month that this would be coming here, i was called paranoid, hypochondriac. Whenever i talk about facts, i feel like a negative nancy just for contributing to the conversation and bringing cold hard facts to the table.

I guess what annoys me is the blind optimism behind it. The virus just got here and people were expecting it to be over within 2 weeks, again, when i said it was impossible and that it would last months, some people shut me off completely. Now, because of their blind optimism, they're shocked that we're still dealing with this. Now it feels like rather than adjusting, they're even more shocked and anxious when things get worse. (it has been 2 weeks today since the virus got here ""OFFICIALLY"" and that the government started acting.) 

I guess what irritates me is that everyone sharing their ""IT WILL BE OK 🌈"" pictures are mostly people who can't accept facts? Of course we will get through this, but we will struggle, it will be hard, and i believe we should mentally prepare rather than just tell everyone that ""it will be ok"" like everything was gonna carry on like normal in 2 weeks. I feel like most people participating hard in that trend are people who don't want to know what will happen and rely on their normalcy bias to keep going. 

I'm sick of being called pessimist for mentally preparing rather than bury my head in the sand like some people have been doing. I've been doing so great in the last few days, great but different. I know i am realistic, i know it's most likely to be hard to get over, socially, mentally, psychologically and economically, i've made ""peace"" with that, and if i'm wrong, then i'll be even more content. I know i should not care what other people think, but i care that i am being judged for not believeing in their rainbows, butterflies, unicorn scenarios where everything will go back to normal next week. It just feels like it soothes anxiety temporarily but it will be harder to get over when things get worse. And a lot of things are not ok for a lot of people already, so it kind of feels priviledge to shout that everything will be ok. I work with people in poverty and those on the street, and trust me, they were already struggling, and they're struggling even more right now. Things are not OK for them. They don't even have the ressource to stay safe. Most don't have a roof on their head, and they're arrested by the police if hanging out outside too long. 

To bring a bit of positivity, i've been saying hi to strangers on the street, smiling to them. I've been talking with strangers in the line to get in the grocery stores. (at a distance). But i can't pretend it will all be ok. 
Not everything will be ok, but we will try our best.

&gt; ""Your information does not link to a reliable source and therefore may not be accurate"". 

The information is linked to not only valid, but is from a research study carried out by a premier research institution, the Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health in Cambridge, UK and published by the Cambridge University Press, UK.

The moderator has also stated that:
&gt; ""If you want to make your own masks, and/or cover your mouth with a scarf or bandana when you are out, please do so but there is NO evidence that the medical masks that healthcare workers need provide significant protection to, healthy, uninfected people who observe the advised distancing measure of 6m from others when out. Using medical masks when there is a shortage puts frontline healthcare workers, and workers who are in regularly in close contact with multiple members of the public - such as supermarket checkout staff - at risk.

&gt; The advice that they are not essential for everyone from Who, CDC and all other reputable agencies is not misleading.

&gt; Please do not let your fears, and misinformation from others, put nurses, doctors and essential workers at risk. This is a time to work together, not to be selfish.""

The above statements indicate that:
1. The moderator who deleted the post has not read the post properly.
2. The moderator's action are based on 'old' information in a constantly evolving situation.
3. The moderator is under the false impression that the post contains misinformation that will put doctors, nurses and essential health care workers at risk.

The above conclusions are based on the observation that the moderator hasn't understood what the title of the post states, namely that: ""A significant number of COVID-19 infected do not show any symptoms therefore masks are likely to have a major impact on the spread of COVID-19 virus in the community and everyone should wear one even if they are homemade."". The title clearly states what new evidence is showing, which is that a significant proportion of people who are infected with the COVID-19 virus DO NOT SHOW any symptoms of the disease. This proportion has been found to be as high as 50% in two studies carried out, one in Iceland and the other in Italy.

The advice to use masks in based on this new finding because the old advice stated that people without symptoms or those who haven't tested positive should not use masks. However, given that testing is only being done on patients who have symptoms, and that 50% of those infected don't show any symptoms, it is CRITICAL that everyone wears masks because those 50% who don't show any symptoms are also spreading the virus to everyone they come in contact with. They might be spreading it more than the confirmed infected case because they remain unaware of the fact that they are infected. Putting on masks will halt this spread. Hand hygiene and physical distancing are required but so is preventing the contamination of common surfaces through oro-nasal secretions.

It is on the basis of above mentioned new development that the advice for everyone to wear masks has been given. It is to prevent spread from people who are infected but not symptomatic who might be as many as 50% of the total infected (equal in number to those with symptoms). Moreover, other studies have also clearly confirmed the benefit of using ANY mask over not wearing a mask for people who are uninfected and the advice in the post was for people to make HOMEMADE masks. In no way is this advice meant to encourage people to take away limited supplies of N95 and surgical masks that are most useful for the healthcare professionals. However, telling people NOT to wear any masks in view of the new findings is intentinally putting their lives and the lives of other community members at risk and this is not acceptable.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/frmody/in_response_to_the_removal_of_post_with_title_a/

329,1585562907,Yozhur,My fight against depression during the time when our world needs us.,"So. What is depression. My vision of depression is a limitation on your mind. It emerges slowly but surely. It affects your mind by limiting your imagination to reality. Every single thing you've experienced in your life is part of that limitation. Everything you've ever felt is part of that limitation. What would it feel to remove that lock on your mind. Think so far ahead. Way beyond the limits of our imagination and mortal shell.Our sole being is brain. When you unlock the potential of it. it will change the way you see the world.  

So, How do we visualize this. Imagine it's a lamp with glass container. What does the container do? It keeps the toxins your mind is emitting from releasing. What if we could remove that container? What would our flame look like? Flame which could burn freely, passionately. That would be a sight to behold. Now that you've that image in your mind. Now think of the words glass container and the flame in your image. Glass container is your depression. Flame is your mind. If we remove the container. Our mind unlocks it's potential.  

I would visualize my feeling of curing depression like this. I felt one with the universe. Universe also felt one with me. It felt like an out of body experience. I saw myself as more than just a human. I saw myself as one being belonging to a higher entity. Looking back to my birth and as far as our extinction. Everything just made sense. As i've spoken about my experiences after feeling this out of body experience. Everyone just marks me as a crazy person. As if i'm having psychosis. But i'm not. My ideas i have after winning the battle against depression. Those ideas just feel too real. Like i know it's right. Other's think its fantasy, but now in my mind everything is a possibility. Everything we've ever done is a culmination to something. What is that something. How could you know. Humans can't visualize things beyond our bodies capabilities to realize our idea. What if you could be connected to everything. Mind to mind. absurd amounts of possibilities rise.

331,1585568100,JenniferColeRhuk,Position on masks,"There have been a number of posts regarding how to obtain, make and wear masks over the weekend that have been alarmist, out of line with advice from reputable agencies and which are causing considerable concern to users of this forum who are already nervous and anxious. Such posts are not helping the situation.

The official advice from WHO is clear:

[https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)

**If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.**

* Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.
* Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
* If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.

See this video from the BBC:

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-51881555/coronavirus-do-face-masks-actually-work](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-51881555/coronavirus-do-face-masks-actually-work)

Until there is peer-reviewed scientific evidence to the contrary, all posts and comments taking an alternate position to the one above will be removed, and posters who persist in pushing this view will be permanently banned. 

It is extremely important at this time that masks are available for those people who actually need them - frontline healthcare workers and those who cannot avoiding coming into contact closer than 2 metres with multiple members of the public in quick succession, such as supermarket checkout workers and bus drivers. Using them when you do not need to puts these people in danger. 

If you are concerned about your chances of catching COVID19, by all means cover your mouth and nose with a scarf or bandana but do not listen to misinformation on the need for everyone to wear masks.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/frp5na/position_on_masks/
332,1585568362,SirHatter,Feel like I should have given up ahead of time,"Context: I'm a gruesomely unhappy person. I probably have no right to be as unhappy as I am, and yet. I have terrible issues regarding isolation and loneliness. In 2018 my fiance left me and I kind of just gave up. Ate my problems away, hid away from society, barely left the apartment. I just wanted to be dead, I figured there wasn't much point to trying.

2019 comes around and for once, I finally decide to try and get better. I work hard, I lose weight, I get a new job, I move to a new town, I do my best to try and integrate into communities (as bad as I am at it), and what was my reward?

""Stay the fuck inside.""

What was the point of all that effort? Why did I bother trying to do any of what I did? I should have just done what I did before, just continued to self-isolate and eat myself to death, at least then it wouldn't have felt like the world was throwing all my effort back in my face.

I can't even convince my friends from college to do things online, and they're stuck inside too. I can't date, I can't socialize, I can't do anything except sit here and wallow in my own self-pity, screaming into the void that is the internet, only to hear ""stay the fuck inside"" echo back at me. Wish I died of a heart attack in 2019 at this rate.

anyway, tl;dr is: man tries to improve, gets told ""fuck off"" by the planet. Don't see an upside. Guess I could use some advice.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/frp7t0/feel_like_i_should_have_given_up_ahead_of_time/

336,1585571876,MightyMighty97,Hoping all my carefulness hasn't been ruined,"I've been self isolating with my mother and grandmother that I help take care of, since the beginning of this month in North Carolina. I've never gone out, groceries have been delivered and then subsequently wiped and washed.

Food is well stocked and I'm not even all that concerned with self-isolation, I can block worries about that off and I have enough content to binge for at least three months haha. 

It doesn't stop the anxiety though. Having allergies, being slightly sleep deprived, and being a mild hypochondriac has caused some psychosomatic symptoms. But I can eventually rationalize those away and have been forming a healthy schedule for myself every day.

My mother contributes to the anxiety by essentially talking constantly to me and on the phone about nothing but the virus and assorted negative outcomes. I can't complain too much as she follows self-isolation protocols pretty carefully....until yesterday.

My uncle who doesnt seem to realize that we're in the middle of an epidemic stopped by. He stopped by here before he was getting ready to hold a church gathering (of about 5 people but even so). He does not care about this shit. My mother knows this and decides to let him in the house. Stand over my grandmother like it was nothing.

I was in shock, but I should've done something. Worst part is I fist bumped him without thinking. Immediately after I did, I washed my hands for about five minutes. And my mother defended her decision by saying he's 'probably' about as healthy as I am and that I should've stopped her whenever I bring this up.

I don't know if I'm more upset over the potential of exposure or angry over my grandmother and I being put in danger via idiocy. I don't know where my uncle had been previously or if his actual level of health. I'm hoping everything's fine but after going through all those precautions to stay safe and feeling good about it only to have it all potentially taken away. I hope my washing of my hands and surfaces touched will save us, but I'm worried about catching it airborne as well.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/frq0o6/hoping_all_my_carefulness_hasnt_been_ruined/
337,1585572230,Jeduka,A Challenging Situation of Coronavirus for International Students - Impact and solutions,"**Remember: Crisis is temporary but dreams are forever.**

After the shock of the sudden spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, you may be worried that you will not be able to study abroad at least this year which can put a pause to your career. Although the situation is a bit worse right now, we want to encourage you to keep your dreams or plans continued, as we know the situations are temporary and everything will be back to normal soon. You will just have to re-plan your decisions for the next few months. So, here are the ways you can adjust to this crisis, while also not giving up on your dream of studying abroad:

**1. Continue your application process if it started.**

If you have decided to study abroad this year, that means you must have already started your application process. And suddenly the virus has emerged as a hurdle in between. But still, you should keep going with the application process as the academic year start of 2020 might not be lost just yet. Usually, the classes in most of the universities would start around in the months of September-October. While it’s difficult to estimate as to when we will be out of this crisis for sure, as the virus is spreading at a high speed, some estimations mention the period between May and July. And then you can start your classes abroad. In fact, some universities are still accepting online applications from international students at this time. If this situation continues further than July, universities will adapt to these changing conditions. Just like students, Universities are also affected by the situation and they will adjust the application and enrolment deadlines which suits the changes in the academic year schedule. So, try to continue going through the steps of the application process. Contacting universities for more information will be best for more clarity. If applications are postponed by the university, then it is the best tie for you to do research about visa information and work permit information, if you plan to work while studying abroad. Some universities have already extended the application dates in August.

**2. Postpone your studies for the beginning of 2021**

If you have not started the application process and want to wait till the problem is solved, there are no issues, you can postpone your international studies for 2021. Or maybe you want to change your initial study destination because it is among those countries which are affected most by the virus. Just because you are not starting your classes this year doesn’t mean you can’t start researching your future study options and decide by January 2021, when the new applications start. Here is how we can help until you start applying:

* Figure out what you want to study and in which country you want to pursue.
* You can check the list of courses and select the course you want to pursue
* Check out the programs, universities cost, etc everything you want to know about study abroad.
* Read about your study options based on careers after graduation
* Read about the exams you will be in need to clear to study abroad like English proficiency exam IELTS or TOEFL and entrance exams like SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT. Prepare for your test and score a good result.TOEFL already launched a way for students to take their language test from home.
* After the quarantine ends, you can gather some professional experience by volunteering, getting a short-term job, or starting an internship. Universities prefer the students who have some work experience for a Master's degree such as an MBA. Click here to know more: MBA universities abroad

Make good use of your time staying at home by doing your research thoroughly, comparing your options and figuring out where you’re going to apply next year.

**3. Study an online degree**

Many prospective international students are considering changing their study plans altogether, and they’re looking at online study options offered by prestigious universities all over the world. Online studies don’t mean low-quality education. Many universities have started offering more online Bachelors and online Masters as a result of the outbreak. This option will likely not delay your study plans too much, as many online degrees have rolling admissions, meaning you can apply anytime. You will still have to meet the admission requirements necessary to apply. Classes can start at any time or once every few months. Just make sure you have the right system requirements on your PC or laptop. The only downside is that your online degree might take more years to complete compared to on-campus options, depending on the course intensity.

**4. Keep learning with online short courses**

No matter which one of the previous options you’re going to choose in the future, you should also not give up on your personal development right now. There is an abundance of online short courses to keep you learning and help you manage your time staying at home. Many of these short distance learning courses are also offered free of charge, and a lot of institutions provide support for people around the world. Setting aside some time every day for an online course can help you better schedule your day and keep your motivation and mental health up. Whichever path you choose to follow, don’t give up on your education dreams and never stop learning.",/r/COVID19_support/comments/frq3v2/a_challenging_situation_of_coronavirus_for/

Since February our company has cut our budget drastically to cope with the losses. We started with cost-saving measures like reducing energy usage and reducing the hours of part-timers. Today I was directed to reduce/terminate contracts with our agencies and freelancers. These are people I worked with for years and consider friends. The collective stress since February came to a head and after I contacted them, I had to go to the restroom to collect myself. I am overwhelmed because I know their livelihoods are affected and I hate that I have to do this; overwhelmed too because now that we are cutting contracts, I don’t know when it will be internal staff next. Every time I see a colleague led into a meeting room, my heart jumps. 

As a salaried white collar who still have my job, who’s not on the frontline, I really feel I don’t have a place to feel this way.

I was breathing like a hamster, My partner was concerned and rang my doctor. The doctor wanted to see me right away just incase it was mild pneumonia. 
An hour later I was seen by my doctor.
He did some checks on me to make sure it wasn't COVID-19 and came back all clear. But I did get diagnosed with Bronchitis. 
The doctor said that he was unable to give me antibiotics and to take ibuprofen to help with the inflammation. That's fine, I'm glad that it isn't COVID-19. 
So I'm sat at home, still unable to breathe, I can't walk fast, go upstairs, play with my son, cough, yawn or laugh without being in absolute agony. 
I'm trying to deal with my pain and not make people fuss over me, but I am getting increasingly concerned about contracting the coronavirus, because unfortunately it can kill people with underlying health issues. And when I think about this, I get seriously terrified.
I wear gloves when dealing with the outside world, essential shopping and going in the garden. I wash my hands constantly and haven't spoken to anyone outside of my house for a month. If I am outside, I'll make sure to cross the road if someone is on the same side as me and keep my distance.

I watched the news today and 2 doctors have died suddenly from the coronavirus and It's making me a nervous wreck.
I can't breathe as it is and if I do get the coronavirus, my chances of survival are even more slim than they were 3 months ago.

While my country doesn't have a lot of infected but the number keep increasing and the thing that worry me the most is that I have to use transit because I can't drive and my work place is far beyond working.

It's really scare me that I don't know whether I will get infected or not and living with 60s parent is really worrying me if I some how got infected.

356,1585591098,EricErikErich,I live with two ICU nurses and I'm trying to decide if I should stay,"Hello all, 

I am looking for advice on a situation that has been putting my anxiety through the roof the past couple of days. 

My partner and I live with two ICU nurses who work at the state's busiest hospital. They both have direct contact with COVID patients as well as direct contact with the other medical staff working with the COVID patients. Every day they share horror stories from the front lines and are visibly angry with the lack of preparedness in which they are expected to work. It's very unsettling.

My question is this: given that this thing is just barely starting to take hold here in Vermont, and that this is expected to get exponentially worse in the coming weeks, is it safe to continue living with these people? They are great friends and we love our house. I have no doubt at all that both of them are following every protocol and taking rigorous steps to protect themselves and others. As a household, we are constantly cleaning, disinfecting, and washing our hands hourly. Still, it seems inevitable that they will be exposed and bring it home with them. One even joked that my partner and I will become immune just because we spend time around them. 

So, do I pack up and get the heck out of dodge before things really hit the fan? Or am I just as safe here as anywhere else given their strict health protocols?

Thanks everyone!",/r/COVID19_support/comments/frvnrr/i_live_with_two_icu_nurses_and_im_trying_to/

358,1585592106,littlemsmuffet,I had to go to the ER yesterday,"So I woke up yesterday with a reacing heart. I felt otherwise fine, hot, sweaty. I figured it was just anxiety. 

But after trying to relax in bed for an hour it wasn't going away. The more I tried to calm it down, the more it tried to beat out of my chest. After another hour I called 911, the paramedics came and said other than my heart rate being high, my other stats seem fine and that if I wanted to go to the hospital I could. They encouraged me to take my Ativan and rest. But that is it came back, to go in to the hospital. So two hours late, I'm feeling ok. But my heart goes totally bonkers.

I put in a mask and hubs dropped me off at the ER. The screen me for covid, everyone is decked it ppe gear and I get brought to a room. Lucky for me I passed a covid patient (or so I assumed because they had droplet warnings on her glass doors) and was taken to a bed. 

After 4 ish hours, I was sent home. They ruled out a heart attack, blood clots and my lungs looked good.

I'm terrified I picked it up at the hospital. They claim it's not aerosol spread only droplets and that the mask I was wearing would protect me. Same with hand washing. 

Thankfully I had no fever, cough, or anything. There testing I did sucked. I'm still scared about my heart ontop of that. But I'm happy I'm home now. 

Hubs had me walk to the washing machine strip and go right to the shower, then bed. 

I didn't go there because I thought I had covid, I didn't want to go because I was scared I'd pick it up. Now the next two weeks I'll be on high alert. 

At least I'm getting lots of rest the my contrast ct showed nothing concerning that I'm aware of (I doubt they would have sent me home).",/r/COVID19_support/comments/frvzm4/i_had_to_go_to_the_er_yesterday/

When the weather is nice out I still go out on walks and do a light jog for at least 45 minutes. I still don't think its enough. 

So now its not just the elderly, those with underlying health conditions, now its those who are overweight, obese who are at risk. What constitutes overweight? So if you have a BMI of 25 or more its just inevitable that you'll develop severe disease?

370,1585598629,sweetbreez,Out of hand sanitizer? This video is very helpful!,"With the lack in hand sanitizer EVERYWHERE, I am hoping that this video will be helpful!

We have all heard the 20 second rule of washing your hands, usually by singing a song, but I like this guy’s technique so much better! To summarize:

You make it 30 seconds: (w/ soap &amp; water of course)
5 seconds rubbing them palm to palm 👏🏻
5 seconds rubbing the top of one hand 🤚🏻 
5 seconds rubbing the top of the other hand 🤚🏻
5 seconds scrubbing your nails against one hand ✊🏻
5 seconds scrubbing your nails from the other hand in the same manner ✊🏻
5 seconds rubbing your hands together with fingers interlinked (sorry, no emoji for that one)
Lastly, 5 seconds rinsing!

The video explains it very well, although I do disagree with him on 2 things. 
1.) For me personally, I would not be touching the knobs to turn the faucet on and off (but it just depends on how conservative with water you are). 
2.) I disagree that bar soap is just as good or better than liquid soap. I do agree that antibacterial soap is useless, but liquid soap in general (it seems) would be cleaner than a bar of soap. That’s just my opinion though!

I know the only way to prevent this would be to literally live in a sanitized bubble, and I also know that I don't take nearly as much as this precaution on an average day and am not constantly infected with the cold or flu, but with how overwhelming this virus is I can't help but feel like I'm bound to get it no matter what just by virtue of existing.

For all of you under lockdown (like me and my family), I know it’s a struggle to adjust to the new reality. Beyond the natural concern about the virus and the bad news from all around, there is another challenge that for many is closer to home (no pun intended). Many might go into a state of stagnation and neglect, with overeating and unending time on screens. If you are worried about this, please read my post on how to turn being stranded at home into more effective and healthier time.

I am doing the best I can staying on my medications, being outside as much as possible, soaking up time with my kids, and relaxing as much as possible, but these horrible thoughts still find their way in and suffocate me. 

I feel like nothing matters. Everything you work toward as a contributing member of society is futile. Nature will always overtake and my efforts don't matter. Like I could die and just be swept under the rug with the others. I need all of this to go away.
